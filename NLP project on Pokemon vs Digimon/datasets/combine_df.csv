1. All 3 pokemon have no x4 weaknesss and only three x2 weaknesses each, and none are weak to fire/water/grass
   1.  Fire/Grass:weak to flying, poison, and rock
   2. Grass/Water:weak to flying, poison, and bug
   3. Fire/Water: weak to ground, rock, electric
2. All 3 pokemon Take neutral damage from 2/3 of the starter types
   1.  Fire/Grass: x1 from fire and water
   2. Grass/Water: x1 from grass and fire
   3. Fire/Water: x1 from water and grass
3. All 3 pokemon have atleast two 1/2 resistances and atleast one 1/4 resistance, and each quadruple resists one of their own typings 
   1.  Fire/Grass: 1/4x damage from grass
   2. Grass/Water: 1/4x damage from water
   3. Fire/Water: 1/4x damage from fire (and ice and steel)

I think these types could work well in a game, especially one that is a bit more unique or unsual like Legends Arceus or Scarlet/Violet.","It would likely never happen but a starter trio that was Fire/Grass, Grass/Water, and Water/Fire is suprisingly balanced While I know it would never likely happen because it is more complicated than what Pokemon usually does for starters- a starter trio whose members end up being Fire/Grass, Grass/Water, and Water/Fire has a suprisingly balanced and cool synergy!

"If you're finding playing Pokemon a bit too easy, here's something I've been doing to spice it up a bit more.",pokemon,"So I've been playing Pokemon a long time, pretty much as long as there's been Pokemon I've been playing it. I've been imposing a self set of rules because of both how easy pokemon is, especially once you know the tricks, and because of a few things I've noticed. 

Skip this paragraph if you just want the rules,but one thing I've noticed when I play Pokemon games is that I always end the game with so much money and so much healing items, and I started to think about why. I think that being able to walk back to a pokemon center and heal, is too convenient, so nobody ever wastes their super potion on a route or in a gym, when they can just go back to the pokemon center and spent a grand total of 45 seconds healing all their mons and getting back to the spot they were at before. The only time the player is really pushed is if they are in caves, but modern caves really don't hold up to OG caves like Mt. Silver, RBY Victory Road, RSE Victory Road, even Mt. Moon (say what you will about Mt. Moon but I have vivid childhood memories of getting lost and feeling like it took forever to navigate). But since nothing ever stops the player from just heading back to the PC whenever, a large chunk of the game like healing items, and even money have less of an impact. 

Alright sorry for the exposition here's the rules I use when I play Pokemon games, just to add a little spice.

-Once you enter a route/gym/hideout, you may not leave that route/gym/hideout through the same way you came in. You have begun a journey forward, go somewhere that isn't where you came from. This means no casual walks back to the Pokemon Center when your 1st mon gets poisoned by Bug Catcher Arnie's Weedle or whatever.

-Save before you enter a route/gym/hideout, if you black out on the route reload the save. Blacking out = no punishment aside from losing a trivial amount of money that you weren't going to spend anyway. Reloading the save means having to refight all the trainers. Now there are stakes. It's like a gentle Nuzlocke. This means that you need to actually prepare for your journey down the next route by buying and using healing items.

-No avoiding wild battles via running away or repels. I think that being able to avoid wild pokemon removes the struggle and adventure aspect of journeying down a route to the next town. The journey wasn't memorable because you avoided everything except two trainers. But when you have to battle every wild Mon, and your PP is running out, and the wild mons keep whittling your health down and tossing the occasional status effect, that's when you feel the struggle, the danger, the adventure of it all. Making it to the next city with one paralyzed pokemon left at 15 HP? Now that was a memorable journey.

-Set mode on. I feel like this doesn't need explaining but being able to always switch to a water type when you know a fire type is coming is hella cheat codes. If anyone complains about how easy the game is but plays with switch mode on, you deserve to get turned into a Shedinja without Wonder Guard.

-No using free heals on routes. This one is a bit minor but some games have the convenient nurse right outside the cave who heals all your pokemon. Don't use it. Or if you think that's a bit harsh, cause sometimes they have a long route, followed by a nurse before a cave, and then another route after the cave, then just limit yourself to once per route.

These are some rules that add some fun to my playthroughs, feel free to comment yours I'd love to read them. Nuzlockes aren't the only way to play some difficult pokemon.","If you're finding playing Pokemon a bit too easy, here's something I've been doing to spice it up a bit more. So I've been playing Pokemon a long time, pretty much as long as there's been Pokemon I've been playing it. I've been imposing a self set of rules because of both how easy pokemon is, especially once you know the tricks, and because of a few things I've noticed. 

Skip this paragraph if you just want the rules,but one thing I've noticed when I play Pokemon games is that I always end the game with so much money and so much healing items, and I started to think about why. I think that being able to walk back to a pokemon center and heal, is too convenient, so nobody ever wastes their super potion on a route or in a gym, when they can just go back to the pokemon center and spent a grand total of 45 seconds healing all their mons and getting back to the spot they were at before. The only time the player is really pushed is if they are in caves, but modern caves really don't hold up to OG caves like Mt. Silver, RBY Victory Road, RSE Victory Road, even Mt. Moon (say what you will about Mt. Moon but I have vivid childhood memories of getting lost and feeling like it took forever to navigate). But since nothing ever stops the player from just heading back to the PC whenever, a large chunk of the game like healing items, and even money have less of an impact. 

Alright sorry for the exposition here's the rules I use when I play Pokemon games, just to add a little spice.

-Once you enter a route/gym/hideout, you may not leave that route/gym/hideout through the same way you came in. You have begun a journey forward, go somewhere that isn't where you came from. This means no casual walks back to the Pokemon Center when your 1st mon gets poisoned by Bug Catcher Arnie's Weedle or whatever.

-Save before you enter a route/gym/hideout, if you black out on the route reload the save. Blacking out = no punishment aside from losing a trivial amount of money that you weren't going to spend anyway. Reloading the save means having to refight all the trainers. Now there are stakes. It's like a gentle Nuzlocke. This means that you need to actually prepare for your journey down the next route by buying and using healing items.

Scarlet and Violet are my favorite Pokemon games for a reason you may not think.,pokemon,"Honestly Scarlet is my favorite Pokemon game of all time.  I always have had rose-colored glasses to the RBY era as they were my introduction into the series.  I know they weren't the best, but they were my favorite, as they got me hooked on Pokemon.  So why did Scarlet move to number 1?  This was the first time that I got to share the adventure with my son.  We wondered through Paldea together and talked about all the cool things we saw as we chose our own unique paths.  One of us would discover some secret and then show the other. We built our own unique teams, and discussed why we liked them.  My favorite moment is when he ran into a Shiny Bagon, and he lost his mind as he had never seen a shiny before.  And when I explained that shinies were a rare form, he was smiling for the rest of the day.  He knew he had encountered something special, and immediately evolved it into Salamence.  These memories are something I will carry with me for the rest of my life, and no Pokemon game will ever replace the thrill and excitement I felt as a father going on a Pokemon journey for the first time with my son in Paldea.","Scarlet and Violet are my favorite Pokemon games for a reason you may not think.

After hours of torment...I finally did it.,pokemon,"First of all, shout-out to Austin John Plays for his SPECTACULAR video detailing how to do this.

Pokémon Team for Royalty,pokemon,"There are some Pokémon that are meant for royals. We got the Pokémon with the word king in its name for starters. Then we got Serperior that is called the regal Pokémon, a male Indeedee where its Pokédex entry says that they are faithful servants, and Florges where her Pokédex entry says that it tends to flowers in a castles garden. That got me thinking about building a Pokémon team for royalty. I already got Serperior, male Indeedee, and Florges. What other three Pokémon should I use to build this royal Pokémon team not including the Pokémon with king in their names?

Edit: Ok, I don’t think I was being specific enough. I meant three other Pokémon for a spoiled brat of a princess with nothing but a dress and makeup. I know it defeats the purpose of this post, but still.","Pokémon Team for Royalty There are some Pokémon that are meant for royals. We got the Pokémon with the word king in its name for starters.

- ORAS Tabitha is the best Pokémon character ever. I love his personality and design. He is handsome, awesome, smart and cool.
- I think that bipedal starters such as Delphox and Incineroar are cool.
- I'm not a fan of Greninja. I don't really like his tongue scarf. 
- I don't really care about Gen 5. Unovan Pokémon are cool, but I don't really feel a connection to the region itself. 
- Galar isn't that bad of a region. SwSh has a flawed story for sure, but I still think that Galar is a nice region.","What are your Pokémon hot takes? Mine are:

[OC] All of the behind the scenes work that goes into turning my artwork into enamel pins! Featuring the Eeveelutions!,pokemon,"(~~for some reason I cannot seem to post an image? Sorry about that, find the referenced images linked below!~~ I realize now it is way past 5pm UTC \^\^; For some reason I thought UTC=PST, my bad! Since this isn't a finished product artwork and more of a behind the scenes thing, leaving it up, but admin, if not okay please feel free to take it down).

I'm working on creating an enamel pin series of Floofelutions -- floofy eeveelutions -- (which see my comment below if you'd like to pre-order via my Kickstarter; it ends tomorrow, Saturday, March 11 at 11am CST!) and I thought it'd be fun to show you the behind the scenes view of what it's like after you've finished the artwork and are working with a manufacturer to create the pins!

I am working with hard enamel pins, which means not only is the enamel (the color filling) hard in texture, the entire pin is made up of a metal base. My two favorites I use are either gold metal or black nickel.

Picture creating pins sort of like stained glass; everywhere there's an enclosed space is a single fill enamel color. But as you can see in some of my examples there's colors layered on top of those colors (i.e. Sylveon, Espeon's head gem) which is what is then called ""screenprinting"" where you pay to have an extra color printed on top of that base enamel color.

Then there's the 'cutouts' and 'recessed metal' bit of a pin. Cutouts are self-explanatory: they're the parts that the manufacturer will literally cut out so there's a hole in the design, i.e. Espeon's tail. Then there's 'recessed metal' which is where the metal is recessed -- i.e. lower than the rest of the design -- to create a depth but not having to fully cut it out. This works for super small areas where a cutout isn't feasible.

I also strive to make sure my designs are uniform across the board, which given how much the Eeveelutions can vary because of their ears or tails is pretty tricky! So you can see that all of them were measured in the paw-to-paw location as that stays the same for this design to make sure they are all kept within proportion of each other.

Check out four of my designs below and hope you enjoyed this behind the scenes look! Be sure to check out my comment if you're interested in getting your own! ♥

Story Time.,pokemon,"TL;DR: 30 year old man relives his childhood dreams last felt with Pokemon Yellow, share your love for the game and what you like the most about it. 

I wanted to share a little story,

Im a 30 y/o man (awaiting an ASD diagnosis) who has played almost every pokemon main game so far, ever since platinum I just stopped enjoying them after a few hours, games became easier and easier and I just didn't get the same feeling from them in the same I did from Yellow, Blue, Gold and Crystal (I plaited them from day of release too) I got Scarlet on day of release and fell in love with it, the sheer idea that I spent 20+ hours playing before getting one badge just because I let the game take me where it wanted, trying to explore everything I could before getting to the school, once I'd done the school part of the story I discovered picnic shiny hunting and went around catching pokemon, exploring and shiny hunting, proceeded with the games story to boost my jumpluff so that it was strong enough to tank moves and put pokemon to sleep, I must have caught half a box of Shiny pokemon, all with only 1 badge, this is truly what this game has to offer! This is what the pokemon series needed to become what it used to be, I felt like a kid again. 

My switch needed to be repaired because my joycons weren't working properly and the repair team messed up, said my switch was fine and factory reset it, all my time and experience just gone...

...only difference is that this time my daughter had her birthday and we got her a switch with pokemon Violet, she fell in love with it the way I did when I played pokemon yellow, I decided to keep booting new games until we both had all three starters, I think found out how to get false swipe and raced my way through to the tera scyther, I was determined to get back to where I was, I got the scyther, obtained false swipe and then I have continued on from where I last left off, only this time, trying to follow the story, catching every new pokemon on the way and doing some occasional shiny hunting for the shinies I used to have.

I have just finished the game story line and I'm now going to fully complete my pokedex and try to re-obtain all pokemon has shiny (excluding locked ones)","Story Time.

Quick question regarding Reproduction Pokémon Games,pokemon,"Some clarifying questions about transferring mons between generations with reproduction carts and authentic carts. 

\-To my knowledge you can trade reproduction gen 3 to authentic gen 3.

\-You cannot trade reproduction gen 3 to gen 4 (authentic or otherwise)

\-You can trade reproduction gen 4 to Pokémon Bank.  


I have seen threads that support this, however I have seen others that say no repro copies can be used with Pokémon transfer or Pokémon bank.  Mainly I'm asking because I don't particularly care about having authentic carts as they will break the bank.

Do the old games REALLY go for that much?!,pokemon,"I've been looking at some used game places lately & it seems like the Pokemon aftermarket is kind of insane.

Something like HeartGold alone seems to be priced in triple-digit territory, even MORE if it has the Pokewalker. Others still seem to be well above the original sticker prices.

I have some copies I've been thinking about selling; nostalgia is fine but I like paying my heating bill more than I like old games. 

Is any of that pricing reliable or are game sellers just greedy???","Do the old games REALLY go for that much?! I've been looking at some used game places lately & it seems like the Pokemon aftermarket is kind of insane.

Questions about Mega evolution,pokemon,"I recently found out that Mega evolution actually causes pain to the Pokémon, which sucks, because I really like Charizard’s in Pokémon Masters EX and they get a stat boost. 

Is there a way around it in other games? Do they still get the stat boost? Can someone explain why or how it hurts them? And if so, why do it to them? (Yes I completely know it’s fictional and just games, I just still don’t want to hurt them since they don’t like it is all. Like if I was “in universe”.) Is there a list of all of the Mega evolutions? Also is Gigantamax the same/similar thing? Any other extra things in lore I need to worry about/know?

(Background is I played gen 1-3 as a kid, but against my parents wishes and had to stop when found out. Had some knowledge when new games would come out but not the list of new Pokémon or lore. Only recently jumped back in (and parents having a change of heart 😊) with Pokémon Masters EX and Sword. So learning more lore and trying to find more games to play and manga to read.)

Day 0,200: Misdreavius!

Huh, I did not know it was spelled like that until today. I would have sworn on everything that it was Misdrevious. Whoops.

But hey, it's the feminine ghost Pokemon!

This cute ghost always makes me think of Flurrie from Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door -- I think it's the necklace and Flurrie being ghost like herself. I'm a little tiffed I didn't name my Misdreavius Flurrie now :c

Speaking of which; I'm not the biggest fan of this shiny but I'm also not super against it. Misdreavius turns into a really off shade of gold/green -- While an ugly shade I do think it assists with the spooky coloring. I can't really complain because it *fits* even if I dislike the color.

I actually have this line done in my Shiny Living Dex! My Shiny Misdreavius is named Poe, named after the little ghosts in Legend of Zelda! It's an adorable little thing.

I think Misdreavius is pretty unique in terms of design -- I think it's interesting and playful but I don't have a lot of high attachments to the Pokemon itself. Evne shiny hunting for one twice didn't really give me a good story for it :/

I've been reigniting my love for Pokemon as of late and have been thinking about doing a living national Dex, aside from event/promo Pokemon. I have Pokemon bank and Pokemon home so that's no issue. Is this even possible? Anything else I should worry about or consider? I plan on playing all of the games so don't worry about things like o
""Oh pokemon **** has a bunch of old mons in it that's a great place to start"" or something like that. For reference I have 



Yellow on the 3ds, LG eevee
HeartGold

I plan on getting ultra moon at some point. Either when it's next to play or I find a good deal.


I'll probably pick up a gen 9 game at some point.



Idk if there's home compatibility but I also have legends Arceus.

A one-page essay on why collecting Pokémon cards as an adult is acceptable; Written brilliantly and in its entirety by artificial intelligence.,pokemon,"Collecting Pokémon cards is often associated with children and nostalgia from the 90s, but in recent years, more and more adults have been getting into the hobby. Some people may question the acceptability of adults collecting these cards, but in reality, there are many reasons why it is a perfectly acceptable hobby for people of all ages.

Firstly, collecting Pokémon cards can provide a sense of joy and excitement for people who have fond memories of the franchise from their childhood. Many adults who collect these cards do so for the nostalgia factor, and there's nothing wrong with reliving happy memories from the past.

Secondly, collecting Pokémon cards can be a fun and rewarding hobby in its own right. The cards themselves are beautifully designed and intricately detailed, and the thrill of completing a set or finding a rare card can be incredibly satisfying. Plus, the trading and social aspects of the hobby can provide opportunities for people to connect and bond over a shared interest.

Thirdly, collecting Pokémon cards can have a financial aspect to it as well. While not all cards will appreciate in value, some rare or highly sought-after cards can be worth a significant amount of money. For some collectors, the potential for financial gain adds another layer of excitement and motivation to their hobby.

Lastly, collecting Pokémon cards is no different from collecting any other type of item, such as stamps, coins, or art. Just because it's associated with a children's franchise doesn't mean it's any less valid as a hobby for adults. In fact, many hobbies that were once considered ""childish"" have become more widely accepted as adult hobbies in recent years, such as comic book collecting or playing video games.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why collecting Pokémon cards as an adult is perfectly acceptable. It can bring joy, provide a fun and rewarding hobby, offer financial potential, and is no different from collecting any other item of interest. As long as it brings happiness and fulfillment to the individual, there is no reason why anyone should feel ashamed or embarrassed for collecting Pokémon cards.","A one-page essay on why collecting Pokémon cards as an adult is acceptable; Written brilliantly and in its entirety by artificial intelligence.

Why don't we have reverse Eevee? It would be such a cool mechanic,pokemon,"We now have multiple Pokemon that can evolve into a few different evolutions, with Eevee being the most well known example. However, we are now nine generations in and still haven't gotten the inverse: a Pokemon that can evolve from multiple preevolutions.

Think about how cool of a mechanic this could be in the game: As a type for the stage 1, normal would probably be the best fit, but parallel to Eevee, the preevolutions could be all sorts of types. The preevolutions could all have different abilities and movesets that the stage 1 could inherit. That would leave you with an incredibly customizable Pokemon, where you have no clue what to expect when facing it, until it actually attacks.

I can only see two issues with this and both would be pretty easy to fix:

* When breeding evolved Pokemon, the babies become the unevolved form. In this case with multiple unevolved forms, simply have the baby decided by ability, as those should still be able to be traced back to the basic form the parent-Pokemon originally evolved from.
* It could be kinda weird for the trading card game:

1. In the trading card game, a stage 1 card usually has marked what Pokemon it evolves from, and there is only room for one on the cards. Not a flawless solution, but you could simply not mark it on the card, and instead give each of the basics an ability that basically says ""You can evolve *That Pokemon* onto *This Pokemon.* This counts as an evolution."" (Last part is important because the TCG has some special rules of when you can evolve)
2. The variable attacks. Very similar solution: Use an ability as well! ""This Pokemon can use attacks from its preevolutions. It still needs to fulfill the energy requirements."" (Sorry if the formulation feels off, English isn't my native language so the trading cards I have also don't have their wordings in English)

This works quite well since the TCG's abilities are quite different from the games in a lot of occasions anyway so it wouldn't matter that those wouldn't be abilities in the games.","Why don't we have reverse Eevee?

1. In the trading card game, a stage 1 card usually has marked what Pokemon it evolves from, and there is only room for one on the cards. Not a flawless solution, but you could simply not mark it on the card, and instead give each of the basics an ability that basically says ""You can evolve *That Pokemon* onto *This Pokemon.* This counts as an evolution."" (Last part is important because the TCG has some special rules of when you can evolve)
2. The variable attacks. Very similar solution: Use an ability as well! ""This Pokemon can use attacks from its preevolutions. It still needs to fulfill the energy requirements."" (Sorry if the formulation feels off, English isn't my native language so the trading cards I have also don't have their wordings in English)

This works quite well since the TCG's abilities are quite different from the games in a lot of occasions anyway so it wouldn't matter that those wouldn't be abilities in the games.",why dont we have reverse eevee it would be such a cool mechanic,why dont we have reverse eevee it would be such a cool mechanic we now have multiple pokemon that can evolve into a few different evolutions with eevee being the most well known example however we are now nine generations in and still havent gotten the inverse a pokemon that can evolve from multiple preevolutions think about how cool of a mechanic this could be in the game as a type for the stage  normal would probably be the best fit but parallel to eevee the preevolutions could be all sorts of types the preevolutions could all have different abilities and movesets that the stage  could inherit that would leave you with an incredibly customizable pokemon where you have no clue what to expect when facing it until it actually attacks i can only see two issues with this and both would be pretty easy to fix  when breeding evolved pokemon the babies become the unevolved form in this case with multiple unevolved forms simply have the baby decided by ability as those should still be able to be traced back to the basic form the parentpokemon originally evolved from  it could be kinda weird for the trading card game  in the trading card game a stage  card usually has marked what pokemon it evolves from and there is only room for one on the cards not a flawless solution but you could simply not mark it on the card and instead give each of the basics an ability that basically says you can evolve that pokemon onto this pokemon this counts as an evolution last part is important because the tcg has some special rules of when you can evolve  the variable attacks very similar solution use an ability as well this pokemon can use attacks from its preevolutions it still needs to fulfill the energy requirements sorry if the formulation feels off english isnt my native language so the trading cards i have also dont have their wordings in english this works quite well since the tcgs abilities are quite different from the games in a lot of occasions anyway so it wouldnt matter that those wouldnt be abilities in the games,13

The idea of a Pokémon battle royal game sounds cool,pokemon,"I was chatting with some friends and the idea of a Pokémon battle royal game came up and we talked through what it might look like. We imagined an early game scramble to catch a Pidgey or Caterpie. Then you battle other trainers and loot their Pokémon or things like potions, master balls, and evolution stones. You could also evolve Pokémon by using them in multiple battles. Imagine an air drop of sorts that drops high level legendaries like Rayquaza, Mewtwo, or Arceus. All leaving the final ""circle"" to be an epic battle for that winner winner torchic(?) dinner screen.

Anyone else agree or have cool ideas for what they'd like to see?","The idea of a Pokémon battle royal game sounds cool I was chatting with some friends and the idea of a Pokémon battle royal game came up and we talked through what it might look like.

Pokemon Violet is my first Pokemon Game!,pokemon,"And it's a terrible execution in game design, UI, performance, graphics, writing, etc. 

I picked it up to play with my younger brother and sister in-law because they asked me to play with them. I've enjoyed the interactions that this game has let me have with them. It's incredibly fun to tear into this the low quality aspects with a group. While this is my first Pokemon game that I've seriously played, I've heard a lot about Pokemon from my extended family so I wasn't going in completely blind.

I've done 3/5 Starfall Street, 4/5 Path of Legends. 6/8 Victory Road.  
It's the Psychic Gym that broke me and made me want to write this post. The gym test is banal and insulting, and it's clumsily executed - you can button mash the emotion prompts repeatedly during the time window (why?). 

The plot hasn't been very engaging. With the exception of the Starfall sections, but they're so short and I expect it to disappoint in the end.

Oh! The sandwich making. Wow. Superjank. I can drop every ingredient on the table and the top half of the bread and still get a 2 star sandwich that fully heals my party. What is this system and why

Ugh. I'm of the opinion that if someone says they like this game, then they are lying to me, are blinded by nostalgia, or they have too much brand loyalty.

&#x200B;

I know Pokemon means a lot to many of you, like it does for members in my Family. However, please consider not purchasing or preordering another game from this IP if this is what they keep coming up with. Interrogate what you've enjoyed about the game in the past and look for something else to fill it.","Pokemon Violet is my first Pokemon Game!

"For fans of primal theory, I have a theory about a certain similarity between Meowscarada and a saber-toothed tiger.",pokemon,"# 

&#x200B;

To begin with, if you are a hater of this theory, just pass by before you minus this post. And it is not necessary to write words that ""You still exist"" and others.

Yes, we exist because and theory has the right to life.

Especially when there is nothing wrong with this theory.

I just happened to notice recently that the sharp end of the Meowscarada mask, lowered down, look like the fangs of a saber-toothed tiger.

Also, this Pokemon has a relatively short tail. They could have made him a long tall, but they made it short.

Which also makes for me a certain resemblance to a saber-toothed tiger.

"Working on a Living National Pokédex, looking for advice, tips, suggestions, etc.",pokemon,"Hey everyone!

I've had a project in the works lately. I'm in the midst of assembling a living dex. For anyone unsure of what that means, it means I'm collecting one of every Pokémon, and storing them in National Pokédex order. So one Bulbasaur followed by an Ivysaur, then a Venusaur, so on and so forth. As a rule, I have to make sure that the Pokémon is captured/bred in the region it was introduced in. For example, a Magmar from the Kanto games, Magby from the Johto games, and Magmortar from the Sinnoh games. So far I have everything possible from Gen 1 to 3, and a good chunk if gens 4 and 5. Some mythical like Mew,, Celebi, and Jirachi I obtained via old events in the past, and am using them. For Jirachi I actually got the Collosseum Bonus Disc and plan to use the Wishmaker Jirachi in my living dex. For Deoxys I'm going to replay OR/AS. With that in mind, do you guys have any recommendations on how to carry on with this? If you've built a living dex before and have advice I'd love to hear it.","Working on a Living National Pokédex, looking for advice, tips, suggestions, etc. Hey everyone!

**200: Misdreavus**

Hey look! It's an incomplete Johto Pokémon line! 

Actually, just how much Misdreavus was screwed over doesn't even stop there. Despite being the ONLY ghost type added in Johto, at a time where the Gastly line was the only other Ghost at all, Misdreavus wasn't even used by the supposed Ghost specialist in the region. It's such a baffling exclusion - you had two options and you went with Gastly evolutions for all of them, Morty. Just... what? Why?!

...but my complaints end there, really. Misdreavus could've been treated better, but it was a good design with an expressive personality. To compliment Gengar's creativity, the second ghost type was a more traditional banshee, just made adorable, and with a feminine witchy vibe with beautiful hair. I adore feminine and elegant Pokémon a lot, and Misdreavus works wonders as a cohesive, ghostly design that is both cute and pretty, setting up for it's evolution into the witchy Mismagius later on.

It also got an incredible Paradox form in Gen 9, so it's certainly a Pokémon who got treated much better over time. But I can't quite gush about that one yet, even if it's super pretty and badass and *who's a good little overpower-Pokemon-immediately-banned-to-ubers, yes, you are\~* D'awww, the Pokémon world couldn't handle it\~

But as for Misdreavus in a vacuum? Beautiful Pokémon with immaculate vibes, and I'm happy it got treated better over time. The only reason it's in **B+ Tier** and not any of the As is because of the steep competition and a few complaints about Mismagius I'll get to later - you might claim that's unfair to Misdreavus, but cute pre-evolutions aren't my favorite archetype, so they generally don't get to the A Tiers on their own.

I brought this up to a friend of mine recently and he'd said that apparently the picnic system was very well received, and I'm like, by who??",so hey am i the only one that absolutely despises the new breeding system,so hey am i the only one that absolutely despises the new breeding system in the previous games with the daycare system i could at least stay busy hatching eggs while waiting for another one to pop up oh yeah and i could also tell when there was another egg ready but there is nothing more goddamn monotonous than standing still in one spot just waiting for eggs to spawn in and then going and hatching them and having to go hatch all of them because you cant just stop hatching eggs once youve got what you want and release the rest i brought this up to a friend of mine recently and hed said that apparently the picnic system was very well received and im like by who,14

The cuteness of pikachu,pokemon,"https://youtu.be/Zz_CYU-LKqA

I was feeling nostalgic for the past and remembered how I introduced Pokémon to my niece who was 2 years old at the time.

I showed her the first episode of the show when it was on Netflix, and within 3 minutes of seeing pikachu she was enamored with him.

After the scene I linked above where pikachu used his tail to swat the ball back at Ash, she giggled and muttered to herself “Pikachoooo!”. I ended up getting her a lot of pikachu themed presents that year.

Now she’s bigger but she audibly goes “Awww” when I show her the old chubby pikachu design! 

It makes me wonder how successful Pokémon would have been if they chose a different mascot!","The cuteness of pikachu https://youtu.be/Zz_CYU-LKqA

What to put free cards in to pass out to kids,pokemon,"Hewwo, I work at a retail store where kids rip open the shiny alluring pokemon card packs just about everyday. I've been collecting what they leave behind since we can't sell it, and giving the TCG codes and any cards needed to a friend who plays competitively. Well anyways, I now have thousands of cards taking up space, and the card stacks are ever-growing bc kids will be kids. I was handing them out at the park to the kids in the neighborhood, but there's been lots of rain this year making it difficult to encounter them and the cards themselves aren't waterproof obviously. I'll be at work when the sun finally comes out and I'll miss them. :(

I was thinking of putting up a display on the table under the pagoda where the kids can take from it freely. The families come in herds, with many mothers and MANY kids at a time so they would be less likely to allow just one child to take it all and would be forced to share it to avoid chaos. What would you use to put, say, about 50 cards in? To waterproof but also keep them rigid. That I can buy in bulk (at hopefully a relatively cheap price)? I have bad experiences with just ziplocks baggies (bent cards, ripped bags), and would like to put them in a bit more formal looking boxes. There must be something, but I can't think of a name of the ""item"" the box to put them in that I can buy in some sort of bulk to hand them out. It's probably something super obvious but the words just escape me and I've been trying to think of it for weeks now. But most the stuff I come across is just not ""card sized"" or holds too many nor comes in bulk.

I've already partitioned the cards into various mixes, they each have commons, medium, rares, vmaxes, holographics and more. So each pack has somewhat equal the goodies they can enjoy.","What to put free cards in to pass out to kids Hewwo, I work at a retail store where kids rip open the shiny alluring pokemon card packs just about everyday.

A bit of a different post today -- A very long super post catching me up because I am *so behind*! A lot of these are gonna be quickfire just so I can get them out so uwu let's get this show on the road!

0,191: Sunkern!

&#x200B;

[Art by  Doopliss on Zerochan!](https://preview.redd.it/u4earngrutma1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=16aa1740d38a2ddb5c98dc54ae37d80ff537d429)

So Hoppip was supposed to represent a seed but I expressed how it kind of made no sense that it was pink and cat like -- I still think it makes little to no sense. Especially when Sunkern is just a few lines down! What they did wrong with Hoppip they did right with Sunkern!

I think Sunkern is such an adorable concept -- It's a little sunflower seed!! LIke -- LOOK AT IT!!

It looks like it's having a good time and I'm here for it. It's such a cool concept that I'm glad that they did right --

I actually have a shiny one of these -- I can't remember if I evolved it or not but it's named ""Pandora"" and I was hunting it on a mirage island on ORAS! She may be a Sunflora now -- I can't really remember >v<;;

Overall I'd put Sunkern in the **B** rank. I think it's a super fun concept that they pulled off really well. I wish they'd take these simple ideas and make them into Pokemon like back then -- I feel like sometimes they go *too* complex with designs lately that they lose out on the charm.

Like where is my DUST BUNNY POKEMON??? I'M WAITING GAME FREAK

0,192: Sunflora!

&#x200B;

[Art by Pokedump on tumblr!](https://preview.redd.it/8ut7r2nbvtma1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=995956e4ec28479e8f013091abd6365c49d1c628)

While I really like Sunkern, I actually don't like Sunflora nearly as much. Which is a shame because Sunflowers are my favorite flowers! I love Sunflowers and feel like they could have done this Pokemon really well -- but they just... didn't?

And it's not even the simplicity of it. You can make designs simple and still work -- Sunflora just... lacks Sunkern's cheer, I think? There's just something off about it.

Honestly I wish they looked more like the adorable Sunflowers in Mario Sunshine. I adored those things when I'd play that game.

But sadly, despite the really good start and my bias for sunflowers, Sunflora still just.. lacks :c Which sucks.

I did like the minigame in S/V when there were like 10 running around you though. That was fun.

**C-**

0,193: Yanma!

&#x200B;

[Art by Decy on twitter!](https://preview.redd.it/g1ei1yxlvtma1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f35eff817cf58aa3a50839999e032c527ed29445)

For a Dragonfly Pokemon, Yanma has a really super interesting design. I thing it's aesthetically nice to look at it and Pokemon stays pretty loyal to the behavior of an actual dragonfly -- Seeing these Pokemon move in the 3D models is really fun because of how erratic they fly! 

While I think these little *buggers* are adorable, they do lack a certain... something to them.

I haven't ever heard of them being used for competitive or even during normal playthroughs; Even with an added evolution later on it doesn't seem to help this line at all which just sort of leaves them abandoned in the 'useless bug' category :c which sucks because they're so cute and interesting! I love dragonflies!

But yeah -- Overall I'll have to put Yanma in **C**.

0,194: Wooper!

&#x200B;

[ cona\_25 on twitter!](https://preview.redd.it/nfk4byhhwtma1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f2178d0b88b9422475a9fcf0f4b8a51e3fd2f9b7)

Lookie at the little Wopper -- whoops I meant Whooper -- Defiinitely don't need to mistake those >v<

But yeah, it's the little axolotl bean! I ***love*** Wooper. Look at its dopey little smile! If you weren't aware already I enjoy Pokemon that loo like they're happy to be alive. Wooper's just a happy little dude and I adore this huggable bean!

Wooper's also pretty memorable to me -- For a long time Wooper was the longest Masuda hunt I ever did. I was well over the 1k's and was struggling hardcore with maintaining the drive to keep going. Coincidentally I had seen a video of an albino exolotl and showed my best friend the video, expressing that it looked like a shiny Wooper

My best friend, knowing I was driving myself nuts with the hunt, made an off hand comment about how I didn't have one and I *immediately* got one as soon as she sent the message. In honor of the albino Axolotl in the video, my shiny Wooper's named Ripley! UwU

But yeah, Wooper's just a cute and adorable bean with an interesting and unique design that leads into one of the (in my opinion) one of the best gen 2 Pokemon to use in game.

Wooper's definitely a **A** Pokemon. 

**Paldean Wooper:** I actually used a Paldean Wooper in my playthrough of S/V and I'll be honest -- I'm not the biggest fan. I prefer the OG Wooper :c It's just... not as much of a huggable bean. **C-**

0,195: Quagsire!

&#x200B;

[Art by Berlin Lopez on tumblr!](https://preview.redd.it/4omn9pf4ytma1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a92bb61d9dd7bd17cdb291ea29ca4efc576d6973)

So, I'll start off the bat that I adore Pokemon that can completely evade their weaknesses just because of their unique typing or abilities. I know that Quagsire is 4x weak to grass, but I'm always so interested in the fact that it's ground typing can completely evade the electric weakness it would have if it was just water! I remember Bertha's Quagsire threw me off *so much* in Diamond and Pearl!

Visually also I just love this Pokemon. It falls into the ""it's just happy to be alive"" and so I can't hate it. I've never used a Quagsire in a game but I wish I could! It's such a fun little dude!

I also have a shiny one of these -- with a less interesting story than Ripley but it's always fun to have a completed line in the Shiny Living Dex!

The only complaints I really have about Quagsire is the 4x weakness to grass -- while also just being *a little* bland? Like, I have no complaints but I also wouldn't complain if there was a little more visually to the Pokemon.

I still love Quagsire though and I'm more than okay with putting it in **A+**

**Paldean Quagsire:** I used one in my playthrough and I'm not gonna lie. I wasn't a fan. I felt like the Pokemon wasn't tanky enough to live long enough and there was just better options in this region that made it less likely to use. Although it *is* the only reason why I beat Eri when I had to poison stall her Annihliape. Regardless this Pokemon's going in the **D** rank. I just... I don't vibe as well with the Paldean forms of this mon.

Day 0,196: ESPEON!!

&#x200B;

[Art by OhSweetsSweetie on tumblr!](https://preview.redd.it/ooyqtwemztma1.png?width=420&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f479ddeb9564e2cd8f79a7d084d66d37ad9e91cd)

&#x200B;

I LOVE ESPEON!! SO MUCH!!!

It's an adorable little psychic cat -- did anybody expect anything different? Espeon's as adorable as it is powerful! 

But the biggest reason for love comes from Pokemon Colosseum when the two Pokemon you start off with is Umbreon and Espeon! I remember becoming enamored with this badass psychic cat the moment I saw her in this game and she became a star player in my team. 

While Espeon isn't my favorite out of the eeveelutions it's definitely in the top 3. I've considered getting matching tattoo's with my best friend of an Espeon/Umbreon duo because even though it isn't my *favorite*, I still like it enough that I wouldn't complain about matching on with my bestie!

The only thing that I have to complain about when it comes to Espeon is that as more Psychic types were introduces and more options were brought up; The less needed it was. Espeon just kind of became a token eeveelution which is a little upsetting but I guess on par for how Eeveelutions work overall. Even if they're important and well loved they don't really live up to the love in terms of being useful in battle.

I still think Espeon is amazing though and I love that it got put in Unite too <3

**A+**

Day 0,197: Umbreon!!

&#x200B;

[Art by OhSweetsSweetie on tumblr!](https://preview.redd.it/90vjhhcl0uma1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2fa7046f5935acbf713019ae38f0ebf844bd3ab7)

While I adore Umbreon, I don't like them as much as I love Espeon. I can get behind the really cool and regal design but it's far more dog like which isn't as appealing to my cat obsessed heart.

For some reason looking for fanart of Umbreon unlocked the memory more than Espeon but I remember being young and on the internet and finding videos online of dramatic love storeis between Espeon and Umbreon -- Using Deviantart inspired fanart to tell the stories of two Eevees in love that are torn apart by.. something or other and evolving to save each other or something lol

They were so cringey but I remember watching each and every one of them I could get my hands on (as well as the cringey Sonic ones but shhh this is a Poke list)

But yeah! Regardless of cringey childhood bias I like Umbreon for what it is but not as much as Espeon. It doens't help that I don't think it's nearly as powerful as Espeon so it gets -- no pun intended -- overshadowed. 

I will admit that it has an awesome shiny though!

Day 0,198: Murkrow!

&#x200B;

[Art by  1-084 on Deviantart!](https://preview.redd.it/v81kkoce1uma1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=39c9e84e6d289d0146f15d699489f861c692d9b3)

Honestly, like HootHoot I feel like it wasn't hard to get this design right. 

But they really did get this design right. I love Murkrow's cute little witches hat added to the crow design! It's so creative and really adds to the design.

It's also hilarious that Murkrow has the same catch rate as Palkia... *for some reason*.

Like I'm so glad that this dumb bird is harder to catch than a literal time god! It's amazingly funny but makes me groan anytime I need to catch a Murkrow for my living dex (which means I normally have to catch two ugh)

But no, I do like Murkrow a lot. I've never used this line and haven't really had a huge drive *to* but the design is appealing enough to rank it at least above average.

Too bad it has a dumb bright pink shiny >:C

**0,199: Slowking!**

Slowking makes me so embarrassed aaaaa -- When I was playing S/V I so desperately wanted to use one on my team but I was really stupid and thought that the line went Slowpoke -> Slowbrow -> Slowking

I completely forgot that it was it's own evolution and you needed to evolve it a special way before it evolved int Slowbro jdakl;fjdsd

I was so upset because I actually really like Slowking. A lot of it may be nostalgia with the Pokemon's major inclusion in the second Pokemon movie; I remember when I saw this Pokemon on the tv I put it up on the same level as *legendaries* because it just seemed super important. 

I'm also a sucker for scarves and it looks like Slowking has one -- so visually I like it way more than Slowbro.

I'd put Slowking in the **B** rank!

**Galarian Slowking:** Nobody look the edge lord is here! No but fr this thing is so goofy looking I can't ever take it seriously. Slowking always gave a sage vibe but Galarian Slowking just kind of looks like a joke lmao. **D**.

A bit of a different post today -- A very long super post catching me up because I am *so behind*! A lot of these are gonna be quickfire just so I can get them out so uwu let's get this show on the road!

0,191: Sunkern!

&#x200B;

[Art by  Doopliss on Zerochan!](https://preview.redd.it/u4earngrutma1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=16aa1740d38a2ddb5c98dc54ae37d80ff537d429)

So Hoppip was supposed to represent a seed but I expressed how it kind of made no sense that it was pink and cat like -- I still think it makes little to no sense. Especially when Sunkern is just a few lines down! What they did wrong with Hoppip they did right with Sunkern!

I think Sunkern is such an adorable concept -- It's a little sunflower seed!! LIke -- LOOK AT IT!!

It looks like it's having a good time and I'm here for it. It's such a cool concept that I'm glad that they did right --

I actually have a shiny one of these -- I can't remember if I evolved it or not but it's named ""Pandora"" and I was hunting it on a mirage island on ORAS! She may be a Sunflora now -- I can't really remember >v<;;

Overall I'd put Sunkern in the **B** rank. I think it's a super fun concept that they pulled off really well. I wish they'd take these simple ideas and make them into Pokemon like back then -- I feel like sometimes they go *too* complex with designs lately that they lose out on the charm.

Like where is my DUST BUNNY POKEMON??? I'M WAITING GAME FREAK

0,192: Sunflora!

&#x200B;

[Art by Pokedump on tumblr!](https://preview.redd.it/8ut7r2nbvtma1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=995956e4ec28479e8f013091abd6365c49d1c628)

While I really like Sunkern, I actually don't like Sunflora nearly as much. Which is a shame because Sunflowers are my favorite flowers! I love Sunflowers and feel like they could have done this Pokemon really well -- but they just... didn't?

And it's not even the simplicity of it. You can make designs simple and still work -- Sunflora just... lacks Sunkern's cheer, I think? There's just something off about it.

Honestly I wish they looked more like the adorable Sunflowers in Mario Sunshine. I adored those things when I'd play that game.

But sadly, despite the really good start and my bias for sunflowers, Sunflora still just.. lacks :c Which sucks.

I did like the minigame in S/V when there were like 10 running around you though. That was fun.

**C-**

0,193: Yanma!

&#x200B;

[Art by Decy on twitter!](https://preview.redd.it/g1ei1yxlvtma1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f35eff817cf58aa3a50839999e032c527ed29445)

For a Dragonfly Pokemon, Yanma has a really super interesting design. I thing it's aesthetically nice to look at it and Pokemon stays pretty loyal to the behavior of an actual dragonfly -- Seeing these Pokemon move in the 3D models is really fun because of how erratic they fly! 

While I think these little *buggers* are adorable, they do lack a certain... something to them.

I haven't ever heard of them being used for competitive or even during normal playthroughs; Even with an added evolution later on it doesn't seem to help this line at all which just sort of leaves them abandoned in the 'useless bug' category :c which sucks because they're so cute and interesting! I love dragonflies!

But yeah -- Overall I'll have to put Yanma in **C**.

0,194: Wooper!

&#x200B;

[ cona\_25 on twitter!](https://preview.redd.it/nfk4byhhwtma1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f2178d0b88b9422475a9fcf0f4b8a51e3fd2f9b7)

Lookie at the little Wopper -- whoops I meant Whooper -- Defiinitely don't need to mistake those >v<

But yeah, it's the little axolotl bean! I ***love*** Wooper. Look at its dopey little smile! If you weren't aware already I enjoy Pokemon that loo like they're happy to be alive. Wooper's just a happy little dude and I adore this huggable bean!

Wooper's also pretty memorable to me -- For a long time Wooper was the longest Masuda hunt I ever did. I was well over the 1k's and was struggling hardcore with maintaining the drive to keep going. Coincidentally I had seen a video of an albino exolotl and showed my best friend the video, expressing that it looked like a shiny Wooper

My best friend, knowing I was driving myself nuts with the hunt, made an off hand comment about how I didn't have one and I *immediately* got one as soon as she sent the message. In honor of the albino Axolotl in the video, my shiny Wooper's named Ripley! UwU

But yeah, Wooper's just a cute and adorable bean with an interesting and unique design that leads into one of the (in my opinion) one of the best gen 2 Pokemon to use in game.

Wooper's definitely a **A** Pokemon. 

**Paldean Wooper:** I actually used a Paldean Wooper in my playthrough of S/V and I'll be honest -- I'm not the biggest fan. I prefer the OG Wooper :c It's just... not as much of a huggable bean. **C-**

0,195: Quagsire!

&#x200B;

[Art by Berlin Lopez on tumblr!](https://preview.redd.it/4omn9pf4ytma1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a92bb61d9dd7bd17cdb291ea29ca4efc576d6973)

So, I'll start off the bat that I adore Pokemon that can completely evade their weaknesses just because of their unique typing or abilities. I know that Quagsire is 4x weak to grass, but I'm always so interested in the fact that it's ground typing can completely evade the electric weakness it would have if it was just water! I remember Bertha's Quagsire threw me off *so much* in Diamond and Pearl!

Visually also I just love this Pokemon. It falls into the ""it's just happy to be alive"" and so I can't hate it. I've never used a Quagsire in a game but I wish I could! It's such a fun little dude!

I also have a shiny one of these -- with a less interesting story than Ripley but it's always fun to have a completed line in the Shiny Living Dex!

The only complaints I really have about Quagsire is the 4x weakness to grass -- while also just being *a little* bland? Like, I have no complaints but I also wouldn't complain if there was a little more visually to the Pokemon.

I still love Quagsire though and I'm more than okay with putting it in **A+**

**Paldean Quagsire:** I used one in my playthrough and I'm not gonna lie. I wasn't a fan. I felt like the Pokemon wasn't tanky enough to live long enough and there was just better options in this region that made it less likely to use. Although it *is* the only reason why I beat Eri when I had to poison stall her Annihliape. Regardless this Pokemon's going in the **D** rank. I just... I don't vibe as well with the Paldean forms of this mon.

Day 0,196: ESPEON!!

&#x200B;

[Art by OhSweetsSweetie on tumblr!](https://preview.redd.it/ooyqtwemztma1.png?width=420&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f479ddeb9564e2cd8f79a7d084d66d37ad9e91cd)

&#x200B;

I LOVE ESPEON!! SO MUCH!!!

It's an adorable little psychic cat -- did anybody expect anything different? Espeon's as adorable as it is powerful! 

But the biggest reason for love comes from Pokemon Colosseum when the two Pokemon you start off with is Umbreon and Espeon! I remember becoming enamored with this badass psychic cat the moment I saw her in this game and she became a star player in my team. 

While Espeon isn't my favorite out of the eeveelutions it's definitely in the top 3. I've considered getting matching tattoo's with my best friend of an Espeon/Umbreon duo because even though it isn't my *favorite*, I still like it enough that I wouldn't complain about matching on with my bestie!

The only thing that I have to complain about when it comes to Espeon is that as more Psychic types were introduces and more options were brought up; The less needed it was. Espeon just kind of became a token eeveelution which is a little upsetting but I guess on par for how Eeveelutions work overall. Even if they're important and well loved they don't really live up to the love in terms of being useful in battle.

I still think Espeon is amazing though and I love that it got put in Unite too <3

**A+**

Day 0,197: Umbreon!!

&#x200B;

[Art by OhSweetsSweetie on tumblr!](https://preview.redd.it/90vjhhcl0uma1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2fa7046f5935acbf713019ae38f0ebf844bd3ab7)

While I adore Umbreon, I don't like them as much as I love Espeon. I can get behind the really cool and regal design but it's far more dog like which isn't as appealing to my cat obsessed heart.

For some reason looking for fanart of Umbreon unlocked the memory more than Espeon but I remember being young and on the internet and finding videos online of dramatic love storeis between Espeon and Umbreon -- Using Deviantart inspired fanart to tell the stories of two Eevees in love that are torn apart by.. something or other and evolving to save each other or something lol

Pokémon pun names,pokemon,"This topic popped up as my 7 year old son was telling me the names of his Pokémon in Violet. He names most of his Pokémon something similar to their type or existing name (Squirt for squirtle, Flame for Charmander, etc) and I’ve only changed the name of my favorite Pokémon (Mastercarp for Magicarp) while keeping the other names the same. He did name his Yungoos “Rick” which had me in fits of laughter with the way he normally names them and started this topic in my head. So, what do you have?","Pokémon pun names This topic popped up as my 7 year old son was telling me the names of his Pokémon in Violet.

Need help figuring out who to put in last two slots of my HGSS replay,pokemon,"Currently replaying Soulsilver and I just beat the eighth gym with the four pokemon I’ve raised so far, now I’m struggling to figure out who I should use in the remaining two slots, and was hoping you guys could help.

"Ice types should resist Ground, Dragon and Flying and do neutral damage vs Water",pokemon,"I don't understand why Ice has no resistances. It's sad that the only Ice type viable pokemon are Glass canon. Why? Pokemons like Mamoswine are big and they should be resistant, they should be tanky. Ice is hard, Ice is not an easy material to deal with. 

&#x200B;

You have to be though to resist in cold temperature, so why every Ice type pokemon is a chips that gets obliterated easily? 

&#x200B;

**Okay, you can't give em Grass and Bug resistance because Grass and Bug are already in a bad state.** 

&#x200B;

But Ground is a very strong type, being super effective against Fire, Rock, Steel, Poison and Electric, it's wouldn't hurt to have Ice resisting it since it's already a super effective typing vs Ground. 

&#x200B;

Dragon because it's already super effective vs Dragon and Dragon doesn't have many weaknesses, it's one of the strongest typing, so it's not like a resistance to it would hurt. 

&#x200B;

 Flying, because Flying is only resisted by Steel and Rock and is super effective against Fighting, Bug and Grass. And because I don't see Birds having enough power to crush ice. Most Birds can't stand the cold... 

&#x200B;

And for Offense, Ice should do neutral damage vs Water and the super effective damage should depend on the weather. 

&#x200B;

For example, an Ice type under a snowy weather would deal supereffective damage against Water because the cold from the weather would help him to freeze the water. 

&#x200B;

And on the opposite side, Water pokemons under rain should be able to do super effective damage against Ice pokemons since Ice melts faster when you have many drops of room temperature weather. 

&#x200B;

That would make an interesting use in the Weather. Weather moves would be more useful and interesting if it's could change the damage chart like this. I know Freeze Dry and Scald exists but it's would be an addition to these 2 moves. 

&#x200B;

Weather could also boost some passives like Thick fat. Thick fat should be 50% more effective under Snow and on the opposite side, under Harsh sunlight, Thick fat isn't effective. That's would make the game more strategic and Weather would play a major role. An effective Typing wouldn't be the only thing needed to beat your opponent which would add more challenge. 

&#x200B;

* **Rework of the Frozen status**

&#x200B;

Frozen shouldn't be a paralysis like Thunder Wave or Stun spore. It's should be more like a slow (big speed reduction + attack and attack spe reduction and def/def spe reduction). The pokemon would still be able to act but he would be greatly disabled which is the normal reaction of the body when you're in hypothermia. You're not completely paralyzed but you're clearly not in a great shape. 

&#x200B;

I think it's important to make Freezing different from Paralysis. Because I don't see what the difference is. I feel like Paralysis is easier to place but the pokemon can still move sometimes which is weird and Frozen is very hard to pull on but then it's completely prevent the enemy pokemon from moving/attacking. Making them different from each other would be nice. 

&#x200B;

**And Ice moves should be super effective vs any frozen target. No matter what typing they have, even if it's a Fire/Steel pokemon for example. If it's frozen, the Ice moves should do super effective damage.** 

&#x200B;

This way, freezing becomes a very interesting status. If you manage to freeze your opponent, he'll have to cure his freezing, otherwise you'll be able to place super effective hits no matter his typing. 

&#x200B;

Or if you think it's would be too OP, in that case we could only add a damage boost against Frozen target for Ice attacks, this way it's wouldn't be too ""OP"" but would still reward you for freezing your opponent. 

&#x200B;

What do you think about these changes? Ice would become a nice powerful typing with that set of moves.","Ice types should resist Ground, Dragon and Flying and do neutral damage vs Water I don't understand why Ice has no resistances.

"Pokémon Yellow glitch/exploit my sister accidentally discovered in the 90s, can't find explanation",pokemon,"So when we all first started playing Pokémon, we had no idea what we were doing, and ended up awkwardly getting through the game with an extremely non-optimized party. When my sister gets to badge 8 in her first playthrough, we all end up losing to Giovanni hundreds of times doing trial and error, and eventually discover a weird trick. Against his Nidoking, Exeggcute will either be immune from all damage, or it will simply use non-damaging moves forever (I forget which). The level difference was such that to win, we had to resort to struggle, but it always worked in the end. Nowhere on the internet in all the years since have I found anyone else who found this, or an explanation for it. The only other weird clue/coincidence I discovered was that in my copy of the Official Pokémon Handbook, the side note about how struggle works happened to be on the same page as Exeggcute, which always made me wonder if someone who wrote that book knew something.","Pokémon Yellow glitch/exploit my sister accidentally discovered in the 90s, can't find explanation So when we all first started playing Pokémon, we had no idea what we were doing, and ended up awkwardly getting through the game with an extremely non-optimized party.

Possible Events or Story Plots hoping to see in Pokémon (2023),pokemon,"Pokémon (2023) is coming up next month as you know. This will be a new start of a new era of the Pokémon anime series. I’m wondering what sort of events we might see in the series especially involving Liko and Roy. Well since we didn’t see much of the Elite Four members make more appearances especially meeting other members from different regions. Also Journeys didn’t show much of Galar or the rest of the Gym Leaders like Kabu and Neesa. If Liko and Roy are traveling to different parts of the world by maybe an airship, anything can be possible. Which of the following might be possible.

Paradox/Primal Reversion,pokemon,"Kinda think this is far fetched, but there kinda are similarities between primal Groudon/future paradox pokemon and primal Kyogre/past paradox pokemon. All the future paradox pokemon have that weird particle glow inside of them similar to primal Groudon, their base forms haven't got that. On the other side there are the past paradox pokemon and Kyogre. This is a bit more vague, but both the past paradox pokemon and primal Kyogre have intense yellow eyes compared to their regular counterparts. So could primal energy have a play in the possible new legendary/time machine. The past paradox pokemon get the primal alpha (beginning/past) energy and the future paradox pokemon get the primal omega (ending/future) energy. Also with the box art legendaries, they all have the ability to influence the battle field in a way.

best way to get started with the card game?,pokemon,"Hi y'all. First of all, I'm a total newbie to this scene. I'm a parent; my childhood was wrapping up by the time pokemon was a thing, so it's not really one of my nerdy passions, but my son's (eight and five) have found their way to pokemon  and have found a new passion.

I support their passions and recognize there is a lot of value to be had and enjoyed there. I watched the remake of the first movie (Mewtwo strikes back) and was surprised at how deep some of the metaphorical values were.

That being said... Right now, to them it's something to watch. We haven't gotten into the video games yet, and I want to encourage them to embrace non-screen-based activities too, so I wanted to buy some cards and learn how to play the game with my eight year old. There seems to be a lot of packages out there. I know it's a collector's game, so to speak, but I just want to have whatever basic stuff we need to start out and enjoy learning the game without getting way deep into collecting and fine tuning decks and stuff.

For those who are into the card game, what would you recommend I get for a first purchase? Is there a package I can buy that will provide enough cards for two players and include everything we will need?

When I imagine it, the one game I think made the biggest changes was Sun and Moon.

Funny GameStop interaction I had while buying Pokémon violet,pokemon,"So I want out to buy Pokémon Violet today after I found out a certain GameStop in my city had a deal going on for scarlet and violet because they had too much in stock and it wouldn't sell.

So originally the price is 60 € and if you buy used it's 50€ which is way too much for a used copy but hey it's GameStop.

So now with the deal a new game is 45€ and so I thought used one would be 35€ which would be a steal. 

So I went there and checked price tags. They had many used once and I wondered why then when looking at cost they boosted the price to 55€.

When I asked why a used copy is more than a new one the employees burst out laughing saying ""well we can't sell it to you cheaper than what it's in the system but this is hella funny""","Funny GameStop interaction I had while buying Pokémon violet So I want out to buy Pokémon Violet today after I found out a certain GameStop in my city had a deal going on for scarlet and violet because they had too much in stock and it wouldn't sell.

What do you want in the DLC?,pokemon,"To prevent certain comments, I think everyone has the right to expect as much as they want from any game, especially from Pokémon, AKA the most famous and remunerative brand in the world. But be coherent with what we already know.

The things I want in the DLC are:

- appropriate level curve in the Indigo Disk (at least 85 to 90);

- showing the story, not just telling it (this is why there should be Heath's flashbacks);

- Kitakami to have accessible buildings and an Okami - like theme;

- Blueberry Academy to have an OST with the Cosmo Canyon and Koopaseum vibes. Also contents and sidequests;

- Blueberry Academy to be the 2.0 version of the League, since Paldea's one is the worst in 27 years;

- Nemona, Arven and Penny returning in the Indgo Disk;


- good character arcs for Carmine and Kieran;


- Terapagos to have two forms and dialogue lines.","What do you want in the DLC?

Which Generation of games do you wish you had grown up with?,pokemon,"Modern Pokemon games are great, but nothing beats the excitement of playing Pokemon with your friends at school in the era that those games first came out. I grew up in the Gen 1-3 era, but didn't start playing until Gen 2 (Gold). I bought Red afterwards since it was still being sold in stores at the time, but nobody was really playing Gen 1 anymore at that time so I didn't get to enjoy it to the fullest extent (though was able to trade some Gen 1 Pokemon to Gold). Gens 2 and 3 however are a different story. They were the newest and most popular games at the time and EVERYONE was playing them. You could trade and battle with friends, spread playground rumors and utilize all of the options available in the games that aren't really available in emulators today, such as Mystery Gift, mixing records in RSE, the Union Rooms in FRLG, E-reader cards to get specific key items, Action Replays/GameSharks and ToysRus giveaways. 

I feel I was lucky to fully experience those games at that time and glad I grew up with those games. Emulators and ROMs are great, but it's hard to fully emulate the experience you had playing those games when they first came out. Likewise some people may have preferred to grow up with later gens to fully experience playing with friends at that time, because when I was in middle school and highschool and the DS games were coming out, not as many people my age were playing anymore so it was a much more solo experience for me, whereas it wouldn't have been if they came out when I was in elementary school. Which era would you have preferred to grow up in?

So about save files being deleted.,pokemon,"I am so concerned about my file being deleted. My version has been updated but I have not bought the dlc. So concerned to the point where I am not even going to play the game to avoid a corrupt save file.

To all those who are having theirs deleted, I feel you and I’m sorry. My little brother deleted my file a while back and I felt really horrible about losing my memories of games I played and the Pokémon I had transferred up to there. I hope we get a patch released for this soon so I can play again.

How to catch them all?,pokemon,"Awesome. Decided to take the plunge down the pokemon rabbit hole. There is about 9 games total on Switch. I have Lets go pokemon, shield, brilliant diamond, scarlet and violet so far but intend to collect and catch them all. 

But what is unclear to me as noob to those games is how do I use pokemon home and when? Do I use it as stickerbook that needs to have one of each? Or is it only temp transfer? Kinda hard to understand If I need the subscription there. 

The other thing is going trough all the Switch games I noticed that there is also line of Pokemon on previous handhelds. I remember as a kid dreaming of getting those games. But it seems it is closing down together with pokemon bank. Should I rush to get it or does it not matter as I can sideload Pokemon Bank on that console later and transfer anyway?

Oh and there is dlc also I suppose. Do I need to get dlc for both versions of game (say scarlet and violet) or is one good enough to catch all the new pokemons in dlc?

Any other tips that you would have welcomed when starting your pokemon journey, add it down bellow.","How to catch them all? Awesome. Decided to take the plunge down the pokemon rabbit hole.

Arceus spoiled me on how easy and fun it is to catch Pokemon.,pokemon,"I spent 15 minutes in battle with a Miltank in Heartgold. Put it to sleep about 10 times.

It makes sense tbh that you could tell your Pokemon to do that. Haha.) 

Wasted 12 Pokeballs, 1 Ultraball, and 5 Friend Balls. IDK if I'm just unlucky or if this is par for the course, but it's deeply frustrating especially because I can't buy any more Pokeballs since I'm out of money. As a kid, I didn't care as much.

"Slowking - Toad's Daily Pokémon Ranking, 199",pokemon,"[Introducing the first alternate evolution to share the same dual type as the original.](https://preview.redd.it/xut7mif94nma1.png?width=1437&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=49adbac1e04695e871ce8852a76c76493d9c3030)

**199: Slowking**

I have to admit, out of all of Johto's weird alternate evolutions, the one that makes the most sense is Slowking. In all honesty, I could've seen Slowking as an evolution to Slowbro - it's name and design are both considerable more intimidating, but even as a split path, this one actually seems to make sense. 

Granted, I've never been... especially fond of the Slowpoke line. If you were to check my previous entries, I criticized it's personality as being one dimensional and overly specific for a species of Pokémon, and admitted that a lot of it's humor was lost on me. However... I think Slowking becomes an exception, in that while it retains a ditzy, oafish look, it boasts actual intelligence in a ditzy way that befits the Psychic typing. Giving Slowpoke, a one dimensional line dependent on another Pokémon for it's only gimmick, a more regal and pompous design element worked surprisingly naturally, and made Slowking more respectable. 

I totally overlooked this design admittedly until Scarlet & Violet, which did it SO much justice. I love it's relationship with Oranguru and how it was implemented mechanically in addition to just Pokedex entries. The ideas of a genuinely intelligent, mystic scholar debating against a doofus pretending to be smart is just a legendary interaction - and Slowking's new signature move, ""Chilly Reception"", is flat out hilarious. Imagine being so unwitty that you tell a joke that causes a snowstorm... and leaving the battle in shame and embarrassment is just a phenomenal cherry on top.

The Slowpoke line was almost entirely confined to the C Tier, but after Generation 9... I have to concede that I immensely underrated Slowking. Take your crown, buddy, you've made it to the **B Tier** alongside all the Pokemon I like with no reservations.

**199\*: Galarian Slowking**

Siiiiiigh. Mark it down in your history books, people, today, I confess, that a Galarian variant for once is not actually an improvement. I admit - I'm biased in favor of the modern design philosophy, Galar and Paldea are my favorite mainline regions. But even I have to admit that this design is awful, ugly, and actually rather insulting. 

What's most insulting is that it's so close to being good! Like, you could've just made the whole thing purple and doubled down on the evil sorcerer vibe. This could've been the Ganondorf of Pokémon with an intimidating, yet regal stature. Instead, we got... this diseased looking, ugly mess of colors.

I hate it. I hate it more because I actually started to like the original. But either way, I won't beat a dead horse - I've yet to meet anyone who likes this form. And if you do, PLEASE tell me why in the comments. For now... **F Tier**.

Since mushrooms are parasitic and absorb nutrients from trees and plants, their type can be effective against plant type Pokémon and also water wouldn't be effective on them as well, since a lot of mushrooms grow in moist places. As for types that could be effective against them, I would choose the bug type, since there are some species of bugs that eat mushrooms. Also, ice type moves would be effective on them, since mushrooms die in the wintertime because of the cold. I would also throw in the normal type, since a lot of creatures in our normal world, like to eat mushrooms.","Should Mushroom Pokémon become their own type in the future?

We need a new Colosseum/XD game,pokemon,"I've been playing Pokemon XD for the first time, and I'm really into it. The shadow Pokemon mechanic gives a fresh take on building a team, making some pokemon viable, and I happen to really like double battles.

The only thing I'm having issues with is some outdated mechanics (lack of fairy type, pre physical-special split, incomplete evolution lines). As I've been playing it, I'd been thinking about how fun it'd be to have a new game in the series. 

Now I think that Game Freak/Pokemon/Nintendo is kinda done with those types of spinoffs games, and while I want a new game, I think they'd mess it up somehow. Thoughts?","We need a new Colosseum/XD game I've been playing Pokemon XD for the first time, and I'm really into it.

"If Frontier Brains Were Gym Leaders, What Types Would They Use?",pokemon,"Title says it all. Tell me your thoughts in the comments.

Disclaimer: Some of my picks are slightly influenced by the anime because those teams fit each Frontier Brain really well. Also, I decided not have repeating types, so each Frontier Brain’s type will be unique to them.

Noland - Bug (Doesn’t have a canonical team, but because he has a Pinsir in Pokémon Masters I went with Bug.)

Greta - Fighting (Has a Heracross and Breloom in the games, and a Hariyama and Medicham in the anime. She also gives off the vibe of being a Fighting-Type trainer with her stance and her belt.)

Tucker - Fire (Has a Charizard in the games and an Arcanine in the anime. Also, he is known for being a performer, and Fire seems to be a fitting type for someone who is flashy in front of a crowd.)

Lucy - Poison (She likes snakes, and people often think of poison or venom when they think of snakes. Seviper is also arguably her most iconic Pokémon and appears both in the games and the anime.)

Spenser - Grass (If we forget about the two Grass types he had in the anime, Spenser just seems like a Grass type user due to his fondness for nature.)

Anabel - Psychic (Aside from having 3 Psychic types in the anime, I just think Psychic fits her well. She has this very elite vibe about her that makes her seem like she has some natural gift for raising powerful Pokémon, and the Psychic type matches that vibe. She also has a purple aesthetic, which helps.)

Brandon - Rock (He’s portrayed as a treasure hunter or a explorer of ancient ruins. We know that he has a Regirock and an anime-exclusive Solrock, but I can also see him with Pokémon like Aerodactyl or Relicanth due to his theme.)

Thornton - Steel (Again, he doesn’t have a canon team, but he does use a Bronzong in Pokémon Masters. He also seems like he would use a Magnezone.)

Dahlia - Ghost (Almost went with Flying because of her Togekiss and Zapdos. However, she does have a Dusknoir, and I could see her with a Drifblim or Mismagius. The Ghost type also kind of matches her hair, which I admit really isn’t saying much since lots of characters have dark black hair.)

Darach - Dark (Houndoom is an iconic Pokémon of his and the Dark type has yet to be used by any other Frontier Brain.)

Palmer - Normal (To me he just looks like he would specialize in the Normal type. Also, he has a Regigigas, and for some reason I can picture him with a Porygon-Z.)

Argenta - Dragon (This one was difficult because she doesn’t have a canon team and she’s not in Pokémon Masters. To decide, I considered which types have yet to be used by other Frontier Brains, which are: Water, Electric, Ice, Flying, Dragon, Ground, and Fairy. I chose to exclude Fairy because that type didn’t exist when Argenta was prevalent. I then narrowed it down to Flying and Dragon because the only Pokémon she’s been confirmed to use in any source of media is Dragonite in the manga. Flying kind of seemed anti-climatic, and honestly Argenta’s design makes her seem like she’s capable of wielding some powerful Pokemon, so I ended up choosing the Dragon type for her. I could legitimately see her using a Kingdra, Salamence, or Garchomp.)","If Frontier Brains Were Gym Leaders, What Types Would They Use? Title says it all. Tell me your thoughts in the comments.

3 Pokemon in a cave?,pokemon,"I have a question. I played Pokémon (every single gen) since a very young age. My brother hooked me up with an emulator on my PC.

I vaguely remember in one of the older versions, I entered a cave to progress the game (can’t remember which cave) and I came across 3 Pokémon (they look like dogs/wolves) standing side by side. If you approach any one of them and interact, you will start a battle. As soon as you try and catch the Pokémon or/and attack it, it flees.

Once the battle screen fades, all three of the Pokémon run off and you cant find them again, Am I imagining it? I was about 9-10 years old when first playing it. It was one of the older games.

How to check if Pokémon are legit?,pokemon,With the 3ds shop closing and all I thought it’d be a good idea to look at some of my copy’s of the game to see if I have any event Pokémon I can send to home. I had bought a copy to platinum years ago from a guy selling the game. Guy seemed legit and all like he’d go to GameStop to get event Pokémon. I wasn’t in the Pokémon community much back then so idk what Pokémon are legit or not. With a quick google search I found OT Pporg is hacked so that got me thinking if the rest are. Is there a way to check cause most of them seem legit with event OT and sum seem hacked like 3 Regis with pokerus (not shiny) but I’m not sure and don’t want to risk getting banned on Pokémon home.,How to check if Pokémon are legit? With the 3ds shop closing and all I thought it’d be a good idea to look at some of my copy’s of the game to see if I have any event Pokémon I can send to home.

what VC games do you suggest?,pokemon,"I haven't played gen 1 or 2, but with the eshop closing so soon I thought I'd give them a try. 

I was originally thinking crystal, blue and yellow but the johto games seem to have more content and are generally well thought of, so I was thinking of also grabbing gold since I love ho-oh. 

now the problem is that the total is a little too much for me. I'd rather narrow it down to three games which I was gonna do by ditching yellow, as I've already played let's go eevee.

are my choices okay or is there a better alternative for the best experience?","what VC games do you suggest? I haven't played gen 1 or 2, but with the eshop closing so soon I thought I'd give them a try.

Gen 1: Does [badge boost glitch] only increase damage of normal hits?,pokemon,"Hi, I've been experimenting with savestates in Pokemon Red (English version), and I noticed after obtaining the first badge that the badge boost glitch only increases maximum damage rolls (0x10D8, visible for 1 frame when attacking) for normal hits, and it doesn't seem to increase maximum damage rolls for critical hits. I'm fighting the 1st trainer on Route 3, and after getting hit by String Shot 4 times, the maximum roll for normal hits increased from 8 to 11, while the maximum roll for critical hits stayed at 12 the whole time. That's kinda strange to me, but I guess that's how it works.

Is it possible that with more badge boosts, normal hits would start dealing more damage than critical hits?","Gen 1: Does [badge boost glitch] only increase damage of normal hits?

"What Do You Look For In A Pokemon Game, AKA What Kind of Pokemon Player are You?",pokemon,"What it says on the tin.  What is it that you play (or used to play) Pokemon for?  Story?  Gameplay?  Exploration?  Music?  Competitive? 

I started with Pokemon Gen 2 (Silver),  so I got spoiled right off the gate with a really dense, content-rich experience as my first Pokemon game, which also shaped my perspective on what a Pokemon game should be:  An RPG game that opens up the world to you, to explore every little nook and cranny, with lots of optional, but engaging, content to indulge in, as well as some non-linear progression for you to customize your adventure.  Let's break down Gen 2's progression style:

* It's linear up until Ecruteak City, after which you have the choice to go left towards Olivine and Cianwood or right to Mahogany and Lake of Rage.  Both are required (along with the Rocket Radio Tower Takeover) to finish the game, and you converge at Blackthorn City for the final badge.  Once you reach Kanto in the post-game, the entire region is open to you to complete in whatever order you desire, minus the Power Plant sidequest to open up Western Kanto.
* Optional areas (meaning you don't even have to set foot in them one time to complete the game):  Dark Cave (all three entrances), Ruins of Alph (and the second half of Union Cave), Whirl Islands, Tin Tower, Mt. Mortar, routes below Blackthorn City, most of Kanto's routes and caves (even moreso in HGSS, since Cerulean Cave and Seafoam Islands were restored).
* The caves that are present here are all dense and multi-floor, labyrinthine and have puzzles to solve (Strength puzzles in some caves, sliding ice puzzles in Ice Path).

So with such a dense experience as my first game, clearly an exploration heavy game, this is what I've come to expect from every title I'd play after this.  I actually played Gen 1 (Red) after Silver, and immediately felt the downgrade in terms of quality of life and what not, but it at least still offered that sense of exploration, and non-linear progression, which starts after you emerge from Rock Tunnel after the first three badges.

Then I would play Gen 3, and it was underwhelming, but still decent, especially Emerald with the Battle Frontier.  Coming off Gen 2 and its sheer content and feature richness, going to Gen 3 and seeing all the removed features for no apparent reason (like Day and Night, and animated Pokemon from Crystal, and the Radio, and no second region to explore) is what made it feel underwhelming to me.  But little did I know, this was actually the start of the series removing features every Generation, with no real reason as to why.

Gen 4 (Platinum is what I played) was pretty nice as well, and has plenty of nooks and crannies to explore, and optional areas.  The post-game with the Battle Area felt like a mini-region on its own to explore, since you could also do that in a non-linear fashion. 

Gen 5 (Black 1 is what I played, followed by White 2) is where I started to notice the shift in the design philosophy of Pokemon games.  Since these were the most story focused games at the time, they heavily sacrificed the ability to explore the region for this.  Not only that, but the map was a literal straight line to the Pokemon league, since the right half of the circle was closed off until the post-game.  The areas did at least feel dense still, and I did notice that all the optional sections were behind the HMs; I don't think you're required to use an HM to get through the main game.   Black and White 2 was much the same, but I was at least happy to see all the additional polish added to the presentation of these games.  Everyone finally animated, including all the generic trainers and even us, if you were in a wifi battle against another player.   I fell off the series after this game though.

It wasn't until Gen 8 (Shield I played specifically) that I tried to return...and that was when I really realized that the games just don't really care about exploration anymore.  That was the most boring, linear Pokemon game I've played yet; even more linear than Gen 5, which I didn't think was possible.  But what made it worse was that there's virtually no optional areas to explore in the game (DLC not included, only talking about the base game here), compounded with the fact that there were no longer any dungeons in the game either.  The only two caves in Galar are both hallways, and single-floor.  The only ""dungeon,"" if you can even call it that, was also just an elevator ride.   I think it was at this point that I started to realize that Pokemon is probably no longer a series about exploring anymore, and is just focused on whatever story they want to tell.  But, being a gameplay first gamer that wants to explore, obviously I don't care about a Pokemon story, so none of the 3D titles have appealed to me since.","What Do You Look For In A Pokemon Game, AKA What Kind of Pokemon Player are You?

red blue and yellow's ost (as well as their remakes) are far superior to every other pokemon game's soundtrack,pokemon,"every song is catchy while maintaining the feelings that their area's atmosphere instills. there is literally not a single forgettable track in these games.

the routes sound courageous and adventurous, as if the game is pushing you forward and encouraging you to explore the tall grass and challenge enemy trainers.

the dungeon themes are eerie and menacing, yet they keep a steady beat that fits in any location, from dark damp caves to abandoned houses and facilities.

the battle themes are just perfect. the wild battle theme is a more robust and basic version of the the trainer theme. it signals danger but its simplicity also represents how the pokemon youre battling is untrained and spontaneous. the trainer theme is of course the exact opposite; an intense symphony that doesnt yield until youve won. both of these themes play throughout the entire game and not once do they become dull to listen to.

im not that new games' osts are bad, but they dont have nearly the same level of consistent quality that the kanto games have","red blue and yellow's ost (as well as their remakes) are far superior to every other pokemon game's soundtrack every song is catchy while maintaining the feelings that their area's atmosphere instills. there is literally not a single forgettable track in these games.

What Even Are The DNA Splicers?,pokemon,"I have no clue what these things are meant to be in-universe. Of course, out of universe, it's your typical McGuffin to allow Kyurem to fuse and explain why it couldn't before but really think about it. What are they? It's a cube that can shape-shift into a long triangular prism that allows Kyurem to unlock the move ""Absofusion"" capable of forcing Reshiram or Zekrom into its body and giving it full control of whichever one and we don't know what it is, whether it's a part of Kyurem that became detached or something, whether it even comes from Kyurem in the first place, whether it was made by someone, why Drayden has it in BW2, how it works, how people discovered it or how people discovered what it does.

I'm reading over the BW2 script and I'm not finding any answers for this. Admittedly, this is an issue with the other McGuffins like the Weather Orbs or the Creation Orbs but at least the fusion items excluding the DNA Splicers were given some explanation. The N-rizers are machines made by Colress to simulate the effects of Necrozma stealing Solgaleo/Lunala's light and the Reins Of Unity are a specially crafted item made for royalty which allows Calyrex to tame its respective steed the same way a human tames a horse. There's a logic there but there isn't really one with the DNA Splicers.

So what's their deal? Are they a part of Kyurem and if so, how did people find them and learn what they do? Or are they man-made and if so, how were they made and why were they made if majority of people didn't think Kyurem was related to the Dragons of Unova at all?","What Even Are The DNA Splicers?

"Theory of Evolution, not quite what it seems?",pokemon,"So here's what perplexes me greatly, we have pokemon, and we have humans. 

There are references to real world animals, which makes your presume animals that are not pokemon, due exist in the pokemon world. But in the shows, we also see very few examples. Probably because pokemon evolved from these creatures. And we know that Arceus, known as a God level entity, is considered a pokemon as we can capture it's avatars. We also know there are extradimensional aliens, that we can also capture as pokemon, and not just in specialized balls. 

But how long has Arceus been around? We know it was there and exists before the time of Hisui and it's said to have created everything. But what exactly IS a pokemon. Did humans, which as primates, come from the same evolutionary lines as earth humans? Or were they just made as human. Why are humans immune to pokeballs? We even see in Hisui that the pokeballs don't have a human noncapture protocol programmed because tech was not of that level. So humans are fundamentally not pokemon. 

Except...when they are. We see from many examples that people do become pokemon. I.E. most ghost types, which would mean that the possibility of the DNA not being a pokemon, but the human is? There are also examples of humans becoming Kadabras, or even isekai'd into it, like the mystery dungeons.

So what makes a pokemon, what it is, and how did humans rise to power in a world that isn't ours? We do know that Arceus enjoys battles. Like the Eternal Battle Reverie in Legends: Arceus. But humans aren't needed to cause pokemon battles. Like wild creatures, the battles can easily happen between species. And we aren't needed to bring out the potential of a pokemon. Others evolve and grow in power without human interaction. 

But it also comes to the question, we know that Arceus is the pokemon God. But... is he our God?  Did Arceus create humans? That part has always been obscure. Was that intentional? Are we immune to the pokemon affects because humans aren't Arceus' children? But something else's children? Maybe that is why humans have to either die, or be transformed into a pokemon. Bring me your thoughts, sources, and theories.","Theory of Evolution, not quite what it seems? So here's what perplexes me greatly, we have pokemon, and we have humans.

I was given a nice surprise when I bought used copies of some 3DS games,pokemon,"I tried posting this as an image, but due to screenshots being banned it was taken down, but I get it. I bought a used copy of Alpha Sapphire so I could complete the ORAS national dex, and to my surprise, the national dex was already completed. It had all 721 Pokémon caught. not only that, but I checked the copies of USUM I bought, and they shared the same trainer name as AS. All of them were owned by ""Andrew"". The first time they ran through the Elite four, was way back in on February 5, 2015. Salamance, Blaziken, Manetric, Gyrados, Latias, and Sceptile.   


Now after the shock and excitement cleared, I realized that they had obtained Arceus, which is impossible to my knowledge to obtain in 3DS games, except through the GameStop Promo.

Now, something that made me wonder if maybe the game had been hacked was that they had 990 masterballs, and several legendaries and mythicals had been caught using the masterball. ""Technically"" you could trade a pokemon with a MB as a held item from one 3ds to another, however the sheer ammount of time that would take is insane and leads me to believe the game was hacked with a homebrewed 3ds or something of the like.

Nonetheless this is still an awesome find considering that i was going to accept not having a few pokemon (such as Arceus) in my dex on the 3ds.","I was given a nice surprise when I bought used copies of some 3DS games I tried posting this as an image, but due to screenshots being banned it was taken down, but I get it. I bought a used copy of Alpha Sapphire so I could complete the ORAS national dex, and to my surprise, the national dex was already completed. It had all 721 Pokémon caught. not only that, but I checked the copies of USUM I bought, and they shared the same trainer name as AS. All of them were owned by ""Andrew"". The first time they ran through the Elite four, was way back in on February 5, 2015. Salamance, Blaziken, Manetric, Gyrados, Latias, and Sceptile.   


Now after the shock and excitement cleared, I realized that they had obtained Arceus, which is impossible to my knowledge to obtain in 3DS games, except through the GameStop Promo.

"Murkrow - Toad's Daily Pokémon Ranking, 198",pokemon,"[Introducing the first Dark Type Pokémon with no pre-evolution.](https://preview.redd.it/o14nn5vl1gma1.png?width=1437&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c0bf6b9d222d1d7fd6517a6988b1918fbba693dc)

**198: Murkrow**

Surprisingly for the bird girl... I do not actually like Murkrow all that much. I think a huge part of this is how little emphasis the bird puts on it's wings, and it's general scrawny appearance where most of it's body is the head. It looks too much like a bobblehead and too cartoonish for me to take seriously or appreciate the witchy symbolism. The head to body ratio really bugs me waaaaay more than it should, and combined with it's gangly talons and beak and the strange unnatural hat brim, I just can't get behind this creature even if I adore both corvids and witches. 

I do want to compliment the tail though. It's very creative to give it the tuft of a broomstick aesthetic so the hat brim doesn't feel totally isolated. Seeing that I'm totally fine with that hat on Honchkrow though, I think it's just more of a consequence of really disliking Murkrow's head. It's just... it's so cartoony, I can't take it seriously! It doesn't look intimidating due to it's scrawniness and lack of mysticism in it's design, nor is it cute or graceful. It's just kind of... a design.

As harsh as I'm sounding though, I cannot put the concept of a witchy corvid Pokémon down too far - it's a **C Tier** to me. Strong concept, below average execution. As a design, it feels out of place and unfinished, and - oh yeah! It's another Johto single stage that clearly does not look fully evolved. Thankfully we get Honchkrow later - and yeeeeeaaah. I know that's going to be a major hot take. I'm bracing myself already.

Macargo and Heatmor,pokemon,"Hello, both of these are Pokemon I like and Pokemon I think need a bit of a buff.

For Macargo I think giving it drought would be good. With Stealth rocks it could be an amazing setup pokemon for a lot of teams. I have another idea that is kind of a reach. You see Turbo chargers in cars kind of look like snail shells and they get hot. We know a certain hot snail. So giving it speed boost to reference this might be interesting. I admit this is a reach but still.

Heatmor is weird. I hated him at first but he grew on me. He is a weird Pokemon so I want him to play kind of weird almost wild card like. So hear me out. What if we gave him Moody as a hidden ability. I Moddy can be a bit of a wild card. It's the origin of the god bidoof meme, because a Bidoof stayed alive long enough for moody to enhance it's stats so high it could one shot Arceus. I admit some say Heatmor's stats are to high for Moody. Bibarel has 410 Base stat total and Heatmor has 484, but Heatmore has a worst typing and more limited move pool.  I want a few more Pokemon to have Moody not a lot but a few and dude it's fricken Heatmor. Without looking it up do you even know what this Pokemon looks like ? What animal is it based off of ?","Macargo and Heatmor Hello, both of these are Pokemon I like and Pokemon I think need a bit of a buff.

For Macargo I think giving it drought would be good. With Stealth rocks it could be an amazing setup pokemon for a lot of teams. I have another idea that is kind of a reach. You see Turbo chargers in cars kind of look like snail shells and they get hot. We know a certain hot snail. So giving it speed boost to reference this might be interesting. I admit this is a reach but still.

Should Toby Fox Be Hired to Work With Gamefreak For The Music of Pokémon from now on?,pokemon,"If you don't know who Toby Fox is he's the guy who created, produced, and composed the game Undertale and he was hired to compose songs/themes in Scarlet and Violet.

Should Gamefreak keep having Toby make these bangers for future Pokemon games?! Because for me it's an absolute YES!!!!

Personally I can see Terapagos having a dual type with Rock, Fairy, or Dragon. Makes sense. So this my list and I think everybody can agree unless you think Terapagos can be another dual type. There is no right or wrong answer. Personally I want Terapagos to be a Fairy/Dragon just because we never had one besides Mega Altaria, but Rock/Psychic makes sense due to Heath connection with Terapagos with the weird dream and Heath don't remember what happened.

I don't currently have a Nintendo console, but I just wanted to know, what are the overall best games in the series? I would probably only be able to play some of the ones from the DS era and back because I would have to use an emulator. I really like the idea of a more chill RPG I can play when I'm not feeling up to playing a online or ""grindy"" game, which is basically all I play nowadays.","A question I've always seen other people be huge fans of Pokémon, and it's always looked pretty fun but I just could never get into it.

I’m Scared,pokemon,"Because if you haven’t heard the recent news, there’s a bug where if you connect Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to Pokémon Go or downloaded the DLC, the bug will literally *delete your save file data*. I’m not joking. Tons of articles about it are online, you can see it for yourself if you want to. This only happened to a couple of people though, and while I think just updating to version 1.2.0, will do that too, I’m honestly super glad I didn’t download the DLC, or connected to Pokémon Go. I would’ve probably had hundreds of hours of hard work flushed down the toilet. I would *not* be happy.

Curious about these odds...,pokemon," Genuinley curious about the odds of finding these pokemon. It's the complete Lechonk evo line, including one male and two females. The first one was full odds before I had the shiny charm. The second two were after I had the charm. I had sparkling power level 3 for WATER types active as well for the two with the shiny charm. By my calculation its P(A and B and C) = 1/4,096 \* 1/512 \* 1/512. In other words.. 1/1,074,741,824. That can't be right, right?

I dislike fakemon.,pokemon,"
As much as I like Pokémon art, there is one thing about the art community that I dislike, and those are the fakemon and the “redesigns”.

First off, I know how much work goes into making fakemon or creating redesigns, and I don’t want work like that to be discredited, and I’m not saying ALL fakemon designs are bad, I’ve seen a few good ones. However I do have some criticisms about modern fakemon and Pokémon redesigns.

Fakemon tend to be designed to look cool and not unique, and that’s one of the problems I have with Fakemon designs.

I simply find fakemon to be quite bland and devoid of any unique personality except “Rawr I’m an edgy cool over the top monster”, many people say, “Oh this fakemon looks so much better than the Pokémon in the games we have today”, and while that may be true, fakemon AREN’T Pokémon. 

Pokemon are unique due to their balance in design, they aren’t made to look too cool or too cute, they are supposed to look like something that a child can bond with and most importantly they are supposed to be memorable. I can’t recall the many times I’ve seen a thousand fakemon designs on Instagram that were just an over the top edgy dragon/monster thingy. 

A sub category of fakemon that I strongly dislike are the ones who redesign the Pokémon, and at times claim to have “fix” a Pokémon’s design. 

Now I honestly think that the process of redesigning a character sounds like a fun thing to do, technically regional forms and the paradox forms can be considered “redesigns”. However I dislike the way that most artists redesign Pokémon, and it’s the same thing with how they design Fakemon, over the top, edgy, and bland, only except they are putting these qualities on Pokémon already exist. The same goes for artists who do regional forms too, if you count regional forms as redesigns. 

To conclude, I respect the work that goes into making fakemon or redesigning Pokemon, but I simply find most designs are bland and devoid of creativity. 

Dare I say it but part of me gets annoyed seeing artists pumping out the cookie cutter formula of making a generic anime monster and labeling it as a Pokémon, regional/paradox form, or a redesign.","I dislike fakemon.

Datamined next raid event : Decidueye,pokemon,"Hello everyone, so it appears to be Decidueye for the next raid event starting on march 13 iirc with the wind tera type.

As well as Greninja, we can't really know which kind of skills Decidueye will have (Special or Physical ?), BUT, knowing Decidueye's skill set, which will be composed of spirit shackle as ghost type, a naturally wind attack and a grass attack with a dark attack and/or set-up moves such as nasty plot/sword dance/double team, and his stats where he has 107 Phy. ATK for 100 Spe. ATK, we can assume that Decidueye will mostly be Physical than Special in his raid.

Considering these facts, and knowing the table type, 2 types should shine against him which are Electric and Ice types.

With these 2 types, and knowing how hard Decidueye will probably hit, we can find that Baxcalibur and Cetitan can be pretty useful Ice tanks (while also dealing strong physical damages to Decidueye as it's physical bulk is pretty low (75)). These two ice pokemon are also quicker than Decidueye (only 70 speed for Decidueye while Baxcalibur hits 87 and Cetitan 73 but can hit even higher with the ability named Slush Rush for Cetitan under snow. Baxcalibur gets a HP Regen with his ability named Ice Body making him more tanky). 

For the electric type, it's pretty hard to find one that will do the job correctly with the list of Pokemon we currently have in S/V, but Miraidon seems to be the most perfect one even though he deals Special damages (Decidueye's Spe Def is at 100 so pretty high).

For the sets I've thought about so far with these 3 Pokemons, here they are :

Miraidon : 
- Taunt
- Parabolic Charge
- Electro Drift
- Reflect/Light Screen/Calm Mind (depends on what you need)

As for the item, I recommend something that will make your Electric terrain last longer, or something that will improve his damages such as life orb or the leftovers if necessary.

Baxcalibur :
- Swords Dance
- Snowscape
- Icicle Crash
- Protect/Substitute (if you want to tank one turn or two to set up) / Rest / Ice Fang 

For the item, pick leftovers if necessary, or either an item that'll last the snow longer or boost your damages. If you used Rest as the last skill, take the mint berry to wake up asap so you don't lose turns.

Cetitan :
- Substitute / Rest / ?
- Bellydrum
- Icicle Crash / Ice Spinner
- Snowscape

Cetitan will definitely need some heal after using Bellydrum which is a bit harsh if you take two consecutive hits from Decidueye under special conditions. Use Sitrus berry if you take Substitute (or Shell Bell, but not really helpful imo). If using Rest, then Mint Berry. If you decide to go all in without Substitute or Rest, then good luck and don't forget to take an item that'll boost your damages !

My Idea for Pokemon moving even after 3DS online gets completely shut down,pokemon,"while currently the talks are only about shutting down the eshop, I think it isnt really up to imagination if the 3DS online services get shut down, but rather WHEN.

and obviously this would completely shut down A LOT in terms of transfer.

gen3 to 4 obviously works due to the Dual-Cartridge DSes and 4 to 5 works via a local transfer.

However 5 to 6, 6 to 7, as well as 1/2(VC) to 7, as well as 6/7 to further generations are COMPLETELY blocked is bank inevitably someday shuts down too.

&#x200B;

so my proposal for this dilemma is the following:

One thing I omitted in the Gen4 to 5 description is that it is not purely a plain local transfer (similar how gen1 to 2 worked), but rather the DS with the gen4 game gets a piece of software, the Pokeporter from the gen5 game via DS Download Play (some people may remember that Mario Kart DS similarly allowed multiplayer with several people who dont even own the game).

&#x200B;

This technique also exists for the 3DS, although I have no idea if or how much it was used.

However using this one could equally create a 3DS Download Play software that works similar to the pokeporter to move the pokemon but this time to Pokemon home over a switch or possibly even mobile phone.

If the 3DS even allows installing of software via Download play, one could even go super creative and create a local ""pokemon box"" style system to move pokemon locally between the generations including VC games.","My Idea for Pokemon moving even after 3DS online gets completely shut down while currently the talks are only about shutting down the eshop, I think it isnt really up to imagination if the 3DS online services get shut down, but rather WHEN.

What if they added more functionality with the different Pokeballs?,pokemon,"I was thinking that it would be nice to be able to switch the ball that your Pokémon is held in, and possibly even have secondary effects added like the heal ball could heal up the Pokémon while you walk. Even maybe adding favourite balls to the different Pokémon based on things like their nature's and typing, that if placed in the ball the Pokémon likes best the friendship grows faster. There probably is also many drawbacks to this so would love to hear what others think.","What if they added more functionality with the different Pokeballs?

Is Curse a one of a kind move?,pokemon,"Curse is either one of a kind, or very rare. 

That being; a move that operates COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY depending on which Pokémon uses it; basically one move acting like 2 entirely different moves. 

When most Pokémon use Curse, it’s a simple +1, +1, -1, stat modifier. 

But when a ghost type uses it, it sacrifices health in exchange for strong damage over time. 

Are there any other moves like this? Yes I know there are some with minor differences, but none I can think of that are basically 2 different moves entirely.

**Nothing else to say other than that it’s kinda cool that it’s one of a kind in this way and I never see anyone acknowledge that. So… show some respect to Curse! :)**","Is Curse a one of a kind move? Curse is either one of a kind, or very rare.

New Pokémon typinp speculation thread,pokemon,"I have not seen a single topic about the new Pokémon's potential typings, so here is one :)

Here are my speculations:

* **Munkidori / Machimashiru**
   * Ice/Poison
   * The blue scheme and pointy chest piece seem to point to a cold species, like a Japanese Macaque.
   * This is an unused typing.
   * Monkeys can fling... junk at intruders \^\^; 
* **Okidogi / Iineinu**
   * Ground/Fighting
   * It looks like a brawler.
   * While we have Great Tusks, that Pokémon lacks a progessive moveset.
   * Rock/Fighting would also be welcomed, given taht only Terrakion has this type.  
* **Fezandipiti / Kichikigisu**
   * Grass/Flying
   * We got robbed TWICE with Decidueye, ditching its Flying type for either Ghost or Fighting.
   * Pheasants have long feathers and Fezandipiti looks like it's attuned to nature.
* **Ogerpon**
   * Dark/Ghost
   * It looks like a spirit wearing an Oni mask, so the typing would address both.
* **Terapagos**
   * Normal

"Why Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky will always be the most emotional video game in my lifetime, and how replaying it has been one of the most intense experiences I've ever had playing a game.",pokemon,"Hey Pokemon players so, I just wanted to share something personal relating to the Pokemon games cause it's been weighing heavy on me. I realize there are limitations to what they really let people post on this subreddit but it would mean a lot to me if this post were allowed, and I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it I was in tears just writing this so, hopefully this story touches someones heart <3 This is the story of Me and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky.  


Anyway, so let's go back to summer 2015. I was in love with a woman named Jess whom I'd known since college, and we were both big Pokemon fans. Once we moved in together, we would wake up on days that we had nothing going on (which was quite often haha) and play on our GBA/DS/3DS with the tv in the background for hours before really getting around to doing anything. It was like our daily ritual! It was 1 of the things early on that really connected us, the love of the Pokemon universe.  


So, 1 day I tell Jess I'm about to replay Explorers of Sky for the first time in a few years. I'd only ever played through it completely twice, as it wasn't THAT old of a game. To my surprise, she had never played it! She did play the original on GBA however. So I ended up getting it on my PC to play on the TV so she could watch me play and take turns playing and enjoying the story. Over the next few days, it was amazing to see her reaction to all the cute little things and all the great twists and turns of the plot of Explorers of Sky! I think we played it for about 6 hours a day for a week straight lol. All of the amazing music from the game was probably her favorite part actually. And after we finished, we would still listen to the music through the jukebox occasionally and go back to grind.  


So teleport us to about 5 months later, she went away to see her family but had to stay there due to her father having a serious health issue, and I couldn't be with her for about 3 weeks, including New Years. I had no idea when she was coming back so it was pretty depressing. But when she was gone I did another replay of that game to pass the time, and found myself really sad playing it without her. The music honestly hurt to hear.

  
The next winter,,,, life was good, we had got engaged on Thanksgiving, and 2 days after Christmas we went to get matching tattoos at a friends house. And then someone hit our car. Yeah,,, she died instantly, it obviously was the worst thing that's ever happened to me. I was alone again on New Years, and all I could think about was the music from Explorers of Sky and it just stung bad. So, the whole reason Im writing about this is because I was always afraid to play this game again. But I finally did it.   


My life is pretty good now, I got clean 15 months ago finally, generally am happy, but, if I was ever gonna fully move on I had to play Explorers of Sky again. I was afraid it would be really depressing but, I found myself crying in a good way, with the parts relating to Grovyle and going to the future and back especially, but most of all with the Steam Caves, and Treeshroud Forest music playing. I never cry, I hadn't since 2021 lol but yeah, this game did it. But I feel like I finally can enjoy what may be the best Pokemon game ever, certainly one of my favorite video games ever made. I feel like she was with me the whole time I was playing it and from now on I'll always be grateful to have this game to go back and feel that connection with her, even if she's not here anymore.","Why Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky will always be the most emotional video game in my lifetime, and how replaying it has been one of the most intense experiences I've ever had playing a game.

Which Pokémon games would you recommend?,pokemon,"Hey guys, please help a returning pokemon player/fan. 

I grown up watching the cartoon when I was a kid but in the past I’ve never had money to buy a gameboy. I’m on my 30s now. A few years ago I finished some classic games in my computer like the Pokémon Red and I enjoyed a lot. 

I recently brought a switch and enjoyed even more finishing Let’s Go Eeve. I also played Pokémon Go for a few years until 2022. 

However playing Pokémon sword in my switch didn’t exactly felt good. Seems like a enormous empty word full of not desirable/weak pokemons. Don’t get me wrong, I know most of them but it’s just seems like a completely negative experience compared with the classic games. Does anybody fell the same way?

Based on my experience, would anybody recommend any new Pokémon games like Arceus or violet/scarlet? I have the feeling they will be more of the same.","Which Pokémon games would you recommend? Hey guys, please help a returning pokemon player/fan.

The many origins of Shiinotic: An overly long analysis of the most underappreciated Alolan Pokémon (tl;dr at the end),pokemon,"Though some may find it forgettable, Shiinotic is my favorite Pokémon of all time, and I'm about to go over all the reasons why through a Reddit post of excruciating length. Alas, Shiinotic is not a very popular Pokémon, and it's easy to see why: a lot of people find it too creepy or uncanny to like, especially compared to Morelull, most of its inspirations aren't immediately obvious, it's never been featured prominently in any of the games, and even in its first appearance it was horribly overshadowed by nearly every other new Grass- and Fairy-type Pokémon. To my knowledge, not one person has ever cared enough about this freaky mushroom-man to write a thorough analysis of its design, its relevance to the Alola region and just why it has the Fairy type... until today.

**Part 1: Mycological Roots**

First, let's take a moment to talk about its heart-meltingly adorable pre-evolution Morelull, an empty-eyed bioluminescent mushroom whose name comes from ""morel"", a famous type of edible fungus, and ""lull"", referring to how its spores can induce sleep; hopefully you haven't been pronouncing it as ""More-lull"". While Morelull may sound innocuous, merely feeding on nutrients from tree roots and soil to sustain itself and never staying in one spot so as not to cause more harm than it needs to, it has potential to be as deadly as any Fairy Pokémon: the Japanese Sun and Moon website speaks of an incident wherein a Morelull colony's spores flew into the vents of an airplane that was flying overhead, putting those on board to sleep and nearly causing a crash!

Shiinotic is best described as ""creepy cute"": it's a taller, more humanoid mushroom with the same hollow eyes as Morelull, but the additions of a blank, off-putting smile and long, green mycelium fingers through which it drains the vitality of seemingly whomever it sees fit, making for one of the more unsettling Fairy-type Pokémon; or, it could be described as a cross between a Toad from Mario and the Landlord from Super Milk Chan. Dangerous as it may be, it's not completely cruel; the anime shows that Shiinotic can also share energy with those they take a liking to, in a similar manner to how mycorrhizal fungi transfer nutrients from the soil to their botanic symbionts. Its name can be broken down into ""shiitake"", a common edible mushroom that grows on decaying wood; ""shine"", referring to its ability to produce phosphorescent light; and ""hypnotic"", referencing the idea of putting one to sleep through hypnotism, the mind-influencing psychoactive agents found within certain mushrooms, and how certain bioluminescent animals beguile prey with their mesmerizing lights.

In most languages, Shiinotic's name pertains to mushrooms and light: in both Japanese and Korean, it is Mashade, and its French name is Lampignon, which reveals that its line also takes inspiration from night lights, lamps and lampshades. The Pokémon Company directly acknowledged this in the promotional artwork for the ""Snorlax's Yawn"" merchandise, which depicts a bedroom filled with all manner of Pokémon-themed furniture, including a Shiinotic bedside lamp situated atop an Aurorus dresser.

Before going into any more detail about what could have inspired Bowling Pin Toad's appearance, it would be wise to first explain its typing. Grass is easy: prior to the revelation that fungi don't actually photosynthesize, they spent ages being conflated with and incorrectly classified as plants. As for Fairy, fairies have been associated with nature, and therefore mushrooms, for almost as long as the idea of fairies has been a thing. Over time, this has lead some lucky 'shrooms to be bestowed with such monikers as ""dryad's saddle"" and ""fairy inkcap"", as well as Shroomish and Breloom being placed in the Fairy Egg Group. During a time when people made less distinction between medical science and magic, the potential medicinal, toxic, or hallucinogenic properties of mushrooms earned them a history of use in ""sorcery"" and shamanic rituals, a trope that still persists in popular culture to this day. In fantasy stories, they're often used as potion ingredients by wizards and witches; funny enough, Shiinotic's design can be read as a literal ""mushroom cloud"" erupting from a cauldron, though it's hard to say whether or not this was deliberate.

The mushroom most frequently depicted in fairy stories and paintings, and arguably the most recognizable fungus of all, is the poisonous and hallucinogenic ***Amanita muscaria***, the red-and-white toadstool commonly known as the fly agaric. You know the one: sometimes it's shown being used as a seat or dwelling by a fairy or gnome, other times it is but one detail in an enchanted forest filled with wonder. It has since been adopted by popular culture as *the* go-to look for a wild mushroom, starting with Renaissance paintings and working its way up through Alice in Wonderland, to The Smurfs, to Mario and Minecraft, to even Pokémon's fifth generation of games, which used it as a basis for Foongus and Amoonguss. Some have also speculated the fly agaric to have religious connotations of varying levels of plausibility, from being the Soma described in ancient Hindu texts, to even being the forbidden fruit consumed by Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.

The *Amanita* genus is best known for its poisonous species, including some of the most toxic toadstools known to man; while some are in fact safe to eat provided they are correctly identified, others contain downright deadly levels of toxins. Though Shiinotic may not be poisonous, lacking the type and only learning one Poison-type move, it shares some of the other trademarks of mushrooms in this genus, including a wide convex cap covered in patches or warts, and a volva - that's the pink, sack-like structure that forms the lower part of Shiinotic's body, a remnant of the universal veil that envelops the mushroom during its infancy.

In addition to *Amanita*, Shiinotic is based on ***Mycena*** fungi, of which 59 species are known to produce **fairy fire**. Fairy fire is one of the three names for the ethereal glow produced by chemical reactions within certain fungi on decaying wood, the others being foxfire and chimpanzee fire. In particular, Shiinotic's pink cap is reminiscent of species such as *M. rosella*, *M. pura* and *M. purpureofusca*; if we branch out to other families, an even closer match is the Pink Waxcap, *Porpolomopsis calyptriformis*. While foxfire-producing fungi mainly emit it from the mycelium, the fruitbody, or both, the slippery mycena (*Roridomyces roridus*) specifically only has bioluminescent spores. The anime shows that this isn't true of Morelull nor Shiinotic, but nevertheless their Pokédex entries mainly describe their light as being emitted from their spores; likewise, *M. pruinosoviscida* is known to emit light from both fruitbody and spores. Other *Mycena* species that may hold relevance here include *M. interrupta* and *M. nargan*, also known as the pixies' parasol and the spotted pixie cap respectively; as well as several species that go by variations of ""fairy helmet"", such as the bleeding fairy helmet (*M. haematopus*).

All of this is, of course, a perfect fit for Alola: bioluminescent fungi are most common in temperate and tropical climates, and Hawaii is known as the Rainbow State (hence Team Rainbow Rocket, the Prism Pokémon Necrozma, Minior's many colors and the bedazzling Bruxish). Hawaii is home to many species capable of producing light - mostly aquatic animals and bacteria, but also the fungus ***Armillaria nabsnona***, whose mycelium is bioluminescent. In general, *Armillaria* are better known as honey fungi, for many of their species have yellow, yellowish-brown or straight-up brown caps that match up with shiny Shiinotic's, such as *A. ostoyae*, *A. luteobubalina* and *A. mellea*.

Honey fungi are an example of a facultative parasite: they grow in the roots of living trees and eventually kill them, but they've adapted to eat both living and dead organic matter - they'll continue to feed on their host even after it perishes, regardless of whether it was actually the fungus that did it in. While Shiinotic's signature move, Strength Sap, is obviously based on how fungi ""sap"" nutrients from their environment through their mycelia, the fact that it drains opponents of their strength yet gives them nothing in return brings to mind parasitic fungi which derive all of their nutrients from their hosts, such as honey fungi. Shiinotic's default color scheme also gives it the most ""psychedelic"" vibe of all fungal Pokémon, which may not be entirely a coincidence: on top of its fly agaric inspiration, magic mushrooms - yes, the ones with hallucinogenic alkaloids - mainly occur in the tropics and subtropics, including Hawaii, where you may come across *Panaeolus bisporus* and *Panaeolus cambodginiensis*.

Yet another potential mycological reference lies in Hachijō-jima, the southernmost of Tokyo's Izu islands. From the end of World War II through the end of the 1960s, the government made efforts to promote it as the ""**Hawaii of Japan**"" to increase investment and property development. It just so happens that multiple species of *Mycena* fungus known to emit a pale green light are abdundant on this island, including *M. chlorophos*, *M. pruinosoviscida*, and *M. lux-coeli*, the last of which was long considered to be endemic to Hachijō-jima until it was found on other Japanese islands decades later.

**Part 2: Mythological Roots**

As mentioned previously, shiny Shiinotic takes its color scheme from various honey fungi, making it the second Pokémon inspired by a parasitic fungus. The first was Parasect, and these two are linked in more ways than just sharing the same base stat total and evolution level: in Pokémon Sun, the Pokémon that attacks when you collect the Tiny Mushroom for the Lush Jungle trial is a Parasect, whereas in Pokémon Moon it is a Shiinotic. In Alola, Paras can only be found during the day, while Morelull is a night-only encounter. The cherry on top is this Shiinotic Pokédex entry:

>Ultra Moon: When it starts fighting for territory with Parasect, the entire area gets completely coated in spores!

Paras only appearing during the day is accurate to real cicadas, most of which are diurnal, but what about Morelull? Well, fairies in general have long been thought to come out exclusively or more often at night, including and up to the **Menehune**, a seldom-seen race of forest-dwellers spoken of in Hawaiian mythology. Though considered fairies, Menehune have more in common with dwarves, including their short, stocky build and exceptional craftsmanship. According to legend, the Menehune reside deep within the mountain forests and caves of Hawaii, away from any human civilization; stand at about 2–3 feet tall, barely shorter than Shiinotic (3'03""); and only be active at night, during which time they would establish fantastic fish ponds, roads, houses and temples. They've been credited with building some of Hawaii's finest ancient architecture before even the first Polynesian settlers arrived there.

In contemporary Hawaii, the term ""Menehune rings"" is sometimes used to refer to **fairy rings**, perfect circles of mushrooms which can cause rings of grass around them to either grow taller or wither and darken, depending on the fungus (ironically, these necrotic zones are the exact thing Morelull does its best to avoid creating). It's certainly no coincidence that three of the fungi able to grow in fairy rings are in the *Amanita* genus, which Shiinotic is already known to draw inspiration from. Even outside of Hawaii, fairy rings lend their name to the vast folklore surrounding them. Let's take a look at some more Pokédex entries:

>Sun: Forests where Shiinotic live are treacherous to enter at night. People confused by its strange lights can never find their way home again.

>Moon: It emits flickering spores that cause drowsiness. When its prey succumb to sleep, this Pokémon feeds on them by sucking in their energy.

>Sword: Its flickering spores lure in prey and put them to sleep. Once this Pokémon has its prey snoozing, it drains their vitality with its fingertips.

>Shield: If you see a light deep in a forest at night, don't go near. Shiinotic will make you fall fast asleep.

This is bog-standard fairy behavior. Many mythological fairies such as redcaps, boggarts, dullahans, rusalki and the nuckelavee were *highly* dangerous to those they crossed paths with; others were said to be or utilize will-o'-the-wisps - known in Welsh folklore as **fairy fire** - which would entrance or bewilder travelers who saw them at night. To reiterate, Shiinotic's territory is generally *not* worth the risk of encroaching on when it's dark out, just as European folktales would often warn not to step in fairy rings.

Since science hadn't yet advanced enough to disprove it, the appearance of fairy rings was attributed to supernatural beings such as elves, witches or fairies dancing in circles, and could be a sign of either good or bad luck depending on the tradition. At worst, consequences for entering them could range from being transported to the realm of the fae, to unwillingly joining in on the nightly dances until your body gives out. Legends would often paint them as being all but impossible to escape from on one's own, and since time was said to pass differently in the otherworld, your trip to Fairyland could have equated to weeks or even years elapsed in the mortal realm, potentially resulting in a near-instant death from old age after breaking free. The only way to safely investigate a fairy ring was to run around it nine times, specifically under the full moon according to a Northumberland tradition. Other creatures said to be linked to fairy rings include dragons, giant bug-eyed toads, and even the Devil himself.

At this point, you may have remembered that fairy rings are not the only mysterious circles associated with night and the paranormal. One could say that **crop circles** are the contemporary equivalent of fairy rings, even if they aren't created naturally. In some ways, aliens are the spiritual successors to traditional fairies in today's popular culture and urban legends, sharing their unknowability, alien morals, and knack for abducting random people or livestock at night without a thought only to bring them back different, sometimes with no memory of what occurred when they were kidnapped. Fairies have enough parallels to aliens that they would fall under the infamous ""ancient astronauts"" conspiracy theory, which implies that mythological beings such as gods, angels and the fair folk themselves were in fact aliens who visited Earth long ago. Another discredited theory linking the two is the ""interdimensional hypothesis"", which says that sightings and legends of beings such as ghosts, fairies and UFOs are really cover-ups for visitors from parallel realities or dimensions.

One of the most common perpetrators of alleged alien abductions are the classic **Gray Aliens**, which Shiinotic lines up with surprisingly well. The Illuminating Pokémon shares the archetypal Grays' pitch-black eyes and short stature compared to humans; it has (hyp)notic in its name, potentially referencing the alien brainwashing trope; and its huge, dome-shaped cap could very well symbolize either an enlarged brain or a flying saucer from which an alien may descend upon Earthlings, or use a tractor beam to do the inverse. Aliens being associated with light is nothing new, either. Some of the very first UFO sightings of the 20th century described them as fiery balls of light in the sky; for somewhat more recent examples, just look at E.T.'s glowing finger, or the scene from Close Encounters of the Third Kind in which colored lights are used to communicate with the extraterrestrial mothership.

This is all too perfect for games titled Sun and Moon: not only are they literally named after celestial bodies, but they also introduced the Light Trio, the astronaut-like Dewpider, the miniature meteor Minior, the extradimensional aliens called the Ultra Beasts, and the seemingly alien NPC in Haina Desert who ""returns to space"" after being shown a Solrock/Lunatone. Moreover, Hawaii has had problems with alien (as in non-native) species for centuries, just not the extraterrestrial kind. Yungoos is based on invasive mongooses that were introduced to Hawaii to control the population of imported rats; the Ultra Beasts are extradimensional beings that are used to wildly different environments from Alola, making them too dangerous to belong there, and Shigeru Ohmori confirmed this to be what the Ultra Beasts symbolize in the first place.

Though there are a couple fungi that are invasive to Hawaii, none seem like they could have inspired Shiinotic. If its creation was influenced by any invasive fungus in particular, it would likely be *Saproamanita inopinata*, one of the two species of *Saproamanita* agaric considered to be invasive by the time Sun and Moon would have started development. *Saproamanita* are in the same family as *Amanita* and were once considered to be the same genus; some species can even grow in fairy rings. *S. inopinata* has not been observed in Hawaii, but rather New Zealand, which has also struggled with invasive species, starting with dogs and rats introduced by Polynesian settlers. This would still fit Alola because some facets of the region were in fact inspired by other Oceanian islands, most notably Komala.

Going back to mythology, there's one last legendary creature that could hold relevance to Shiinotic, and if you're a Studio Ghibli fan, you may have already guessed what it is: the **kodama**, literally meaning ""tree spirit"" in Japanese. Kodama are a kind of nature deity, said to be the animated souls of the ancient trees they inhabit; the few reported sightings of kodama describe them as faint wisps or orbs of light, or as lights with tiny humanoids inside them. The Ghibli movie Princess Mononoke has what is by leaps and bounds the most famous portrayal of kodama, depicting them with entirely white skin and black dots for eyes and mouths. Pokémon is no stranger to referencing other modern media (case in point: Lokix and Baxcalibur; even the very foundation of the franchise, Poké Balls, are an Ultraman reference) so I could totally believe that the Ghibli kodama had an influence on Shiinotic's design.

**The Verdict**

Well, that's pretty much it. In conclusion, Shiinotic is one of the most inspired, well-thought out Pokémon that Generation VII has to offer, tying together a multitude of mycological and mythological references from Europe, Hawaii and Japan alike into an original forest sprite that wouldn't feel out of place in any number of fairy stories, yet also manages to remind us of more modern analogues of the fair folk. Taking into account all these different origins, it's hard to find a Pokémon more deserving of the Fairy type than Shiinotic.

**Tl;dr:** Shiinotic's potential inspirations include lamps and lampshades; mushrooms' folkloric ties to fairies and magic; a literal ""mushroom cloud"" erupting from a witch's cauldron; various fungi of the *Amanita*, *Mycena*, *Porpolomopsis*, *Armillaria* and *Saproamanita* genera, some of which produce fairy fire; Parasect, serving as its nocturnal counterpart and rival; nocturnal Hawaiian fairies known as Menehune; fairy rings, also known as Menehune rings; the double meaning of ""fairy fire"", referring to both will-o'-the-wisps and fungal bioluminescence; Gray Aliens and UFOs; and kodama, specifically the ones from Princess Mononoke.","The many origins of Shiinotic: An overly long analysis of the most underappreciated Alolan Pokémon (tl;dr at the end) Though some may find it forgettable, Shiinotic is my favorite Pokémon of all time, and I'm about to go over all the reasons why through a Reddit post of excruciating length.

The Pokémon Company directly acknowledged this in the promotional artwork for the ""Snorlax's Yawn"" merchandise, which depicts a bedroom filled with all manner of Pokémon-themed furniture, including a Shiinotic bedside lamp situated atop an Aurorus dresser.

Before going into any more detail about what could have inspired Bowling Pin Toad's appearance, it would be wise to first explain its typing. Grass is easy: prior to the revelation that fungi don't actually photosynthesize, they spent ages being conflated with and incorrectly classified as plants. As for Fairy, fairies have been associated with nature, and therefore mushrooms, for almost as long as the idea of fairies has been a thing.

All of this is, of course, a perfect fit for Alola: bioluminescent fungi are most common in temperate and tropical climates, and Hawaii is known as the Rainbow State (hence Team Rainbow Rocket, the Prism Pokémon Necrozma, Minior's many colors and the bedazzling Bruxish). Hawaii is home to many species capable of producing light - mostly aquatic animals and bacteria, but also the fungus ***Armillaria nabsnona***, whose mycelium is bioluminescent. In general, *Armillaria* are better known as honey fungi, for many of their species have yellow, yellowish-brown or straight-up brown caps that match up with shiny Shiinotic's, such as *A. ostoyae*, *A. luteobubalina* and *A. mellea*.

Honey fungi are an example of a facultative parasite: they grow in the roots of living trees and eventually kill them, but they've adapted to eat both living and dead organic matter - they'll continue to feed on their host even after it perishes, regardless of whether it was actually the fungus that did it in.

The only way to safely investigate a fairy ring was to run around it nine times, specifically under the full moon according to a Northumberland tradition. Other creatures said to be linked to fairy rings include dragons, giant bug-eyed toads, and even the Devil himself.

At this point, you may have remembered that fairy rings are not the only mysterious circles associated with night and the paranormal. One could say that **crop circles** are the contemporary equivalent of fairy rings, even if they aren't created naturally. In some ways, aliens are the spiritual successors to traditional fairies in today's popular culture and urban legends, sharing their unknowability, alien morals, and knack for abducting random people or livestock at night without a thought only to bring them back different, sometimes with no memory of what occurred when they were kidnapped. Fairies have enough parallels to aliens that they would fall under the infamous ""ancient astronauts"" conspiracy theory, which implies that mythological beings such as gods, angels and the fair folk themselves were in fact aliens who visited Earth long ago. Another discredited theory linking the two is the ""interdimensional hypothesis"", which says that sightings and legends of beings such as ghosts, fairies and UFOs are really cover-ups for visitors from parallel realities or dimensions.

One of the most common perpetrators of alleged alien abductions are the classic **Gray Aliens**, which Shiinotic lines up with surprisingly well. The Illuminating Pokémon shares the archetypal Grays' pitch-black eyes and short stature compared to humans; it has (hyp)notic in its name, potentially referencing the alien brainwashing trope; and its huge, dome-shaped cap could very well symbolize either an enlarged brain or a flying saucer from which an alien may descend upon Earthlings, or use a tractor beam to do the inverse. Aliens being associated with light is nothing new, either. Some of the very first UFO sightings of the 20th century described them as fiery balls of light in the sky; for somewhat more recent examples, just look at E.T.'s glowing finger, or the scene from Close Encounters of the Third Kind in which colored lights are used to communicate with the extraterrestrial mothership.

This is all too perfect for games titled Sun and Moon: not only are they literally named after celestial bodies, but they also introduced the Light Trio, the astronaut-like Dewpider, the miniature meteor Minior, the extradimensional aliens called the Ultra Beasts, and the seemingly alien NPC in Haina Desert who ""returns to space"" after being shown a Solrock/Lunatone. Moreover, Hawaii has had problems with alien (as in non-native) species for centuries, just not the extraterrestrial kind. Yungoos is based on invasive mongooses that were introduced to Hawaii to control the population of imported rats; the Ultra Beasts are extradimensional beings that are used to wildly different environments from Alola, making them too dangerous to belong there, and Shigeru Ohmori confirmed this to be what the Ultra Beasts symbolize in the first place.

Though there are a couple fungi that are invasive to Hawaii, none seem like they could have inspired Shiinotic. If its creation was influenced by any invasive fungus in particular, it would likely be *Saproamanita inopinata*, one of the two species of *Saproamanita* agaric considered to be invasive by the time Sun and Moon would have started development. *Saproamanita* are in the same family as *Amanita* and were once considered to be the same genus; some species can even grow in fairy rings. *S. inopinata* has not been observed in Hawaii, but rather New Zealand, which has also struggled with invasive species, starting with dogs and rats introduced by Polynesian settlers. This would still fit Alola because some facets of the region were in fact inspired by other Oceanian islands, most notably Komala.

Going back to mythology, there's one last legendary creature that could hold relevance to Shiinotic, and if you're a Studio Ghibli fan, you may have already guessed what it is: the **kodama**, literally meaning ""tree spirit"" in Japanese. Kodama are a kind of nature deity, said to be the animated souls of the ancient trees they inhabit; the few reported sightings of kodama describe them as faint wisps or orbs of light, or as lights with tiny humanoids inside them. The Ghibli movie Princess Mononoke has what is by leaps and bounds the most famous portrayal of kodama, depicting them with entirely white skin and black dots for eyes and mouths. Pokémon is no stranger to referencing other modern media (case in point: Lokix and Baxcalibur; even the very foundation of the franchise, Poké Balls, are an Ultraman reference) so I could totally believe that the Ghibli kodama had an influence on Shiinotic's design.

**The Verdict**

Well, that's pretty much it. In conclusion, Shiinotic is one of the most inspired, well-thought out Pokémon that Generation VII has to offer, tying together a multitude of mycological and mythological references from Europe, Hawaii and Japan alike into an original forest sprite that wouldn't feel out of place in any number of fairy stories, yet also manages to remind us of more modern analogues of the fair folk. Taking into account all these different origins, it's hard to find a Pokémon more deserving of the Fairy type than Shiinotic.

**Tl;dr:** Shiinotic's potential inspirations include lamps and lampshades; mushrooms' folkloric ties to fairies and magic; a literal ""mushroom cloud"" erupting from a witch's cauldron; various fungi of the *Amanita*, *Mycena*, *Porpolomopsis*, *Armillaria* and *Saproamanita* genera, some of which produce fairy fire; Parasect, serving as its nocturnal counterpart and rival; nocturnal Hawaiian fairies known as Menehune; fairy rings, also known as Menehune rings; the double meaning of ""fairy fire"", referring to both will-o'-the-wisps and fungal bioluminescence; Gray Aliens and UFOs; and kodama, specifically the ones from Princess Mononoke.",the many origins of shiinotic an overly long analysis of the most underappreciated alolan pokémon tldr at the end,the many origins of shiinotic an overly long analysis of the most underappreciated alolan pokémon tldr at the end though some may find it forgettable shiinotic is my favorite pokémon of all time and im about to go over all the reasons why through a reddit post of excruciating length alas shiinotic is not a very popular pokémon and its easy to see why a lot of people find it too creepy or uncanny to like especially compared to morelull most of its inspirations arent immediately obvious its never been featured prominently in any of the games and even in its first appearance it was horribly overshadowed by nearly every other new grass and fairytype pokémon to my knowledge not one person has ever cared enough about this freaky mushroomman to write a thorough analysis of its design its relevance to the alola region and just why it has the fairy type until today part  mycological roots first lets take a moment to talk about its heartmeltingly adorable preevolution morelull an emptyeyed bioluminescent mushroom whose name comes from morel a famous type of edible fungus and lull referring to how its spores can induce sleep hopefully you havent been pronouncing it as morelull while morelull may sound innocuous merely feeding on nutrients from tree roots and soil to sustain itself and never staying in one spot so as not to cause more harm than it needs to it has potential to be as deadly as any fairy pokémon the japanese sun and moon website speaks of an incident wherein a morelull colonys spores flew into the vents of an airplane that was flying overhead putting those on board to sleep and nearly causing a crash shiinotic is best described as creepy cute its a taller more humanoid mushroom with the same hollow eyes as morelull but the additions of a blank offputting smile and long green mycelium fingers through which it drains the vitality of seemingly whomever it sees fit making for one of the more unsettling fairytype pokémon or it could be described as a cross between a toad from mario and the landlord from super milk chan dangerous as it may be its not completely cruel the anime shows that shiinotic can also share energy with those they take a liking to in a similar manner to how mycorrhizal fungi transfer nutrients from the soil to their botanic symbionts its name can be broken down into shiitake a common edible mushroom that grows on decaying wood shine referring to its ability to produce phosphorescent light and hypnotic referencing the idea of putting one to sleep through hypnotism the mindinfluencing psychoactive agents found within certain mushrooms and how certain bioluminescent animals beguile prey with their mesmerizing lights in most languages shiinotics name pertains to mushrooms and light in both japanese and korean it is mashade and its french name is lampignon which reveals that its line also takes inspiration from night lights lamps and lampshades the pokémon company directly acknowledged this in the promotional artwork for the snorlaxs yawn merchandise which depicts a bedroom filled with all manner of pokémonthemed furniture including a shiinotic bedside lamp situated atop an aurorus dresser before going into any more detail about what could have inspired bowling pin toads appearance it would be wise to first explain its typing grass is easy prior to the revelation that fungi dont actually photosynthesize they spent ages being conflated with and incorrectly classified as plants as for fairy fairies have been associated with nature and therefore mushrooms for almost as long as the idea of fairies has been a thing over time this has lead some lucky shrooms to be bestowed with such monikers as dryads saddle and fairy inkcap as well as shroomish and breloom being placed in the fairy egg group during a time when people made less distinction between medical science and magic the potential medicinal toxic or hallucinogenic properties of mushrooms earned them a history of use in sorcery and shamanic rituals a trope that still persists in popular culture to this day in fantasy stories theyre often used as potion ingredients by wizards and witches funny enough shiinotics design can be read as a literal mushroom cloud erupting from a cauldron though its hard to say whether or not this was deliberate the mushroom most frequently depicted in fairy stories and paintings and arguably the most recognizable fungus of all is the poisonous and hallucinogenic amanita muscaria the redandwhite toadstool commonly known as the fly agaric you know the one sometimes its shown being used as a seat or dwelling by a fairy or gnome other times it is but one detail in an enchanted forest filled with wonder it has since been adopted by popular culture as the goto look for a wild mushroom starting with renaissance paintings and working its way up through alice in wonderland to the smurfs to mario and minecraft to even pokémons fifth generation of games which used it as a basis for foongus and amoonguss some have also speculated the fly agaric to have religious connotations of varying levels of plausibility from being the soma described in ancient hindu texts to even being the forbidden fruit consumed by adam and eve in the garden of eden the amanita genus is best known for its poisonous species including some of the most toxic toadstools known to man while some are in fact safe to eat provided they are correctly identified others contain downright deadly levels of toxins though shiinotic may not be poisonous lacking the type and only learning one poisontype move it shares some of the other trademarks of mushrooms in this genus including a wide convex cap covered in patches or warts and a volva  thats the pink sacklike structure that forms the lower part of shiinotics body a remnant of the universal veil that envelops the mushroom during its infancy in addition to amanita shiinotic is based on mycena fungi of which  species are known to produce fairy fire fairy fire is one of the three names for the ethereal glow produced by chemical reactions within certain fungi on decaying wood the others being foxfire and chimpanzee fire in particular shiinotics pink cap is reminiscent of species such as m rosella m pura and m purpureofusca if we branch out to other families an even closer match is the pink waxcap porpolomopsis calyptriformis while foxfireproducing fungi mainly emit it from the mycelium the fruitbody or both the slippery mycena roridomyces roridus specifically only has bioluminescent spores the anime shows that this isnt true of morelull nor shiinotic but nevertheless their pokédex entries mainly describe their light as being emitted from their spores likewise m pruinosoviscida is known to emit light from both fruitbody and spores other mycena species that may hold relevance here include m interrupta and m nargan also known as the pixies parasol and the spotted pixie cap respectively as well as several species that go by variations of fairy helmet such as the bleeding fairy helmet m haematopus all of this is of course a perfect fit for alola bioluminescent fungi are most common in temperate and tropical climates and hawaii is known as the rainbow state hence team rainbow rocket the prism pokémon necrozma miniors many colors and the bedazzling bruxish hawaii is home to many species capable of producing light  mostly aquatic animals and bacteria but also the fungus armillaria nabsnona whose mycelium is bioluminescent in general armillaria are better known as honey fungi for many of their species have yellow yellowishbrown or straightup brown caps that match up with shiny shiinotics such as a ostoyae a luteobubalina and a mellea honey fungi are an example of a facultative parasite they grow in the roots of living trees and eventually kill them but theyve adapted to eat both living and dead organic matter  theyll continue to feed on their host even after it perishes regardless of whether it was actually the fungus that did it in while shiinotics signature move strength sap is obviously based on how fungi sap nutrients from their environment through their mycelia the fact that it drains opponents of their strength yet gives them nothing in return brings to mind parasitic fungi which derive all of their nutrients from their hosts such as honey fungi shiinotics default color scheme also gives it the most psychedelic vibe of all fungal pokémon which may not be entirely a coincidence on top of its fly agaric inspiration magic mushrooms  yes the ones with hallucinogenic alkaloids  mainly occur in the tropics and subtropics including hawaii where you may come across panaeolus bisporus and panaeolus cambodginiensis yet another potential mycological reference lies in hachijōjima the southernmost of tokyos izu islands from the end of world war ii through the end of the s the government made efforts to promote it as the hawaii of japan to increase investment and property development it just so happens that multiple species of mycena fungus known to emit a pale green light are abdundant on this island including m chlorophos m pruinosoviscida and m luxcoeli the last of which was long considered to be endemic to hachijōjima until it was found on other japanese islands decades later part  mythological roots as mentioned previously shiny shiinotic takes its color scheme from various honey fungi making it the second pokémon inspired by a parasitic fungus the first was parasect and these two are linked in more ways than just sharing the same base stat total and evolution level in pokémon sun the pokémon that attacks when you collect the tiny mushroom for the lush jungle trial is a parasect whereas in pokémon moon it is a shiinotic in alola paras can only be found during the day while morelull is a nightonly encounter the cherry on top is this shiinotic pokédex entry ultra moon when it starts fighting for territory with parasect the entire area gets completely coated in spores paras only appearing during the day is accurate to real cicadas most of which are diurnal but what about morelull well fairies in general have long been thought to come out exclusively or more often at night including and up to the menehune a seldomseen race of forestdwellers spoken of in hawaiian mythology though considered fairies menehune have more in common with dwarves including their short stocky build and exceptional craftsmanship according to legend the menehune reside deep within the mountain forests and caves of hawaii away from any human civilization stand at about  feet tall barely shorter than shiinotic  and only be active at night during which time they would establish fantastic fish ponds roads houses and temples theyve been credited with building some of hawaiis finest ancient architecture before even the first polynesian settlers arrived there in contemporary hawaii the term menehune rings is sometimes used to refer to fairy rings perfect circles of mushrooms which can cause rings of grass around them to either grow taller or wither and darken depending on the fungus ironically these necrotic zones are the exact thing morelull does its best to avoid creating its certainly no coincidence that three of the fungi able to grow in fairy rings are in the amanita genus which shiinotic is already known to draw inspiration from even outside of hawaii fairy rings lend their name to the vast folklore surrounding them lets take a look at some more pokédex entries sun forests where shiinotic live are treacherous to enter at night people confused by its strange lights can never find their way home again moon it emits flickering spores that cause drowsiness when its prey succumb to sleep this pokémon feeds on them by sucking in their energy sword its flickering spores lure in prey and put them to sleep once this pokémon has its prey snoozing it drains their vitality with its fingertips shield if you see a light deep in a forest at night dont go near shiinotic will make you fall fast asleep this is bogstandard fairy behavior many mythological fairies such as redcaps boggarts dullahans rusalki and the nuckelavee were highly dangerous to those they crossed paths with others were said to be or utilize willothewisps  known in welsh folklore as fairy fire  which would entrance or bewilder travelers who saw them at night to reiterate shiinotics territory is generally not worth the risk of encroaching on when its dark out just as european folktales would often warn not to step in fairy rings since science hadnt yet advanced enough to disprove it the appearance of fairy rings was attributed to supernatural beings such as elves witches or fairies dancing in circles and could be a sign of either good or bad luck depending on the tradition at worst consequences for entering them could range from being transported to the realm of the fae to unwillingly joining in on the nightly dances until your body gives out legends would often paint them as being all but impossible to escape from on ones own and since time was said to pass differently in the otherworld your trip to fairyland could have equated to weeks or even years elapsed in the mortal realm potentially resulting in a nearinstant death from old age after breaking free the only way to safely investigate a fairy ring was to run around it nine times

[Rebuild Tuesday] Electivire,pokemon,"Hey Trainers!

Welcome to this week's edition of Rebuild Tuesday, a weekly event we're doing along with our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pokemon)!

This week's Pokémon is **Electivire**!

**#466 Electivire** (Japanese エレキブル)

*Thunderbolt Pokémon*

*It pushes the tips of its two tails against the foe, then lets loose with over 20,000 volts of electricity.*

**Electivire's Base Stats:**

* **HP:75** 
* **Attack:123** 
* **Defense:67** 
* **Sp. Attack:95** 
* **Sp. Defense: 85** 
* **Speed:95** 

[**Smogon Info**](https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/pokemon/electivire/)

**Introduction:**

Hey trainers, Welcome back to Rebuild Tuesday! This week we are going to be looking at Electivire, a mon who has had a very sad, gradual fall from grace. Debuting in Diamond and Pearl this 123 attack monster was in OU; moving down a tier with each generation it now finds itself in PU. It’s mediocre speed of 95 and terrible bulk makes it highly prone to being revenge-killed.
Motor Drive allows Electivire to increase its negligible speed and provides immunity to electric moves, which it already resists. Vital Spirit means that it is immune to sleep.

Welcome to this week's edition of Rebuild Tuesday, a weekly event we're doing along with our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pokemon)!

This week's Pokémon is **Electivire**!

**#466 Electivire** (Japanese エレキブル)

*Thunderbolt Pokémon*

*It pushes the tips of its two tails against the foe, then lets loose with over 20,000 volts of electricity.*

**Electivire's Base Stats:**

* **HP:75** 
* **Attack:123** 
* **Defense:67** 
* **Sp. Attack:95** 
* **Sp. Defense: 85** 
* **Speed:95** 

[**Smogon Info**](https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/pokemon/electivire/)

**Introduction:**

Hey trainers, Welcome back to Rebuild Tuesday! This week we are going to be looking at Electivire, a mon who has had a very sad, gradual fall from grace. Debuting in Diamond and Pearl this 123 attack monster was in OU; moving down a tier with each generation it now finds itself in PU. It’s mediocre speed of 95 and terrible bulk makes it highly prone to being revenge-killed.
Motor Drive allows Electivire to increase its negligible speed and provides immunity to electric moves, which it already resists. Vital Spirit means that it is immune to sleep. It is outclassed by stronger electric types such as rotom and its poor move pool leaves it walled out by many common walls such as mudsdale.
How would you change Electivire so that it can become viable despite the aforementioned weaknesses. Does terastallizing improve the viability of Electivire? How would you rebuild Electivire to be viable in either SV given DLC or SwSH where it is currently available?

**How viable do you trainers think Electivire is? Is there anything else you think it needs in order to be a good competitive Pokémon (e.g. new moves, stats, abilities or typings)? What is its most optimal set?**

"Espeon & Umbreon - Toad's Daily Pokémon Ranking, 196 & 197",pokemon,"[Introducing the first Pokémon to expand a family beyond four Pokémon ](https://preview.redd.it/rl13ufrqf7ma1.png?width=1437&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=12e66dfa149d6a25e6beab66bc338046b3dfddee)

**196: Espeon**

Another Eeveelution! And I've got to say, Johto's Eeveelutions are of extremely high quality. Not that bad Eeveelutions exist, they do not, but Espeon and Umbreon as a duo feel absolutely fantastic in the way they contrast each other. They both have very similar vibes of mystical power beyond mortal comprehension, combined in a package that is both abstract yet absolutely adorable, maintaining the creative chimera like elements of Eevee's design.

Between the two of the however, Espeon is the simpler design by far with a body that can arguably be accused of falling into the Gen 1 monochromatic body problem, which while not a deal breaker for me on a Pokémon this small, does detract from it. But it's elegance is communicated instead by it's shape, two tails, and the gem on it's forehead. It's effectively what Alolan Meowth would kill to be, an actual graceful and superior feline.

Compared to the Kantonian Eeveelutions, I think Espeon ends up pretty close to Vaporeon. The latter design feels more cohesive to me, with more creative elements, but I can't shake my love of Espeon's beautiful vibes. While Vaporeon edges it out, they both stand among the best Eeveelutions in y eyes in the **A+ Tier**. 

[Fanart by the appropriately named Espeongirl360](https://preview.redd.it/17ulrb3bh7ma1.jpg?width=430&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=13712bd88d10ae03c6b6fb3b8e9e1198bfe84f43)

&#x200B;

**197: Umbreon**

In case it wasn't clear by now, I'm a huge fan of Eevee and it's evolutions. And here we arrive at my absolute favorite out of all of Eevee's evolutions, my favorite Pokemon in all of Johto (and Kanto), and my 13th favorite Pokémon prior to Gen 9. I share that last piece of trivia because man does it feel fitting that the black cat is the unlucky number. 

But Umbreon honestly feels perfect to me. I'm a huge fan of black cats with emboldened yellow eyes, and definitely a cat girl in real life. Not to say that the Eevees are cats, they're chimeras with elements of dogs and rabbits mixed in, but that only enhances the appeal. More over, Umbreon does an excellent visual balance in putting more yellow lunar symbols across it's body to break up the monotony of black fur, in a way that both looks really intimidating and aesthetically pleasing at once. 

Umbreon feels like a masterclass balancing act of preserving cuteness, power, and elegance in one simple and cohesive design, and I love it a lot. It strikes at so many trends I like in Pokémon, and I'm not surprised that it's my favorite Pokémon discussed in the series so far. Also, I don't talk about shinies much, but it's shiny is BLUE and it looks BEAUTIFUL, I love the color blue and the way it glows and contrasts with the - aaaaaaaa! ...man I recognize that yellow is objectively more symbolic but if Umbreon used the shiny palate it probably would be S Tier for me.

You might find it strange that nearly two hundred posts into the series and after all this gushing about Umbreon being my favorite so far, that I don't rank Umbreon in the S Tier yet. Sorry, that's a very exclusive club - there were only 7 S-Tier Pokémon before Gen 9. There's probably still not that many, even if that's my favorite Generation. I like to keep my list of absolute favorites very narrow. Umbreon IS, however, the very top of the **A+ Tier** so far, a position more than deserved. I love this thing!

**Postscript:**

Okay side note. Y'know how Vaporeon has the reputation for furry bait...? Uh, looking up fanart for Umbreon was WAAAAAY harder than Vaporeon, there were a lot of humanoid hot Umbreons. Just a weird observation. 

Also, I'm really behind, sorry. School's been tough. I have been keeping track of where I'm supposed to be though - yesterday was intended to be Murkrow and today Slowking. I'll probably get everything caught up through Misdreavus by tomorrow, just in time for the big 200.

But the problem is, I still don't think GameFreak has properly embraced the extra dimension.  I'll start off by saying the problems that they've been having in 3D.

To begin with, there's this concept of [Uncanny Valley.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley)  Ever since Pokemon has been 3D by the mainline games, since X and Y, they've entered this, and never left it.  Here are some examples why.

* **They continue to use the 3D Models in the same manner as they have their 2D sprites in battle, and it doesn't work in 3D**:  In the 2D games, the battlefield was an abstraction.  We don't see how much actual distance there is between the battling mon, they're just attacking on circular disc stages, and our mind is able to fill in the gap of what happens between easier as a result.  When a mon uses Tackle and nudges the air on their circle, we can easily imagine them running across X distance to actually ram into the opponent.  However, in 3D space, this no longer works.  We can see exactly how much physical distance there is between the mon.  So, staying on one side of the battlefield and nudging the air here is one of the examples of the games still being in Uncanny Valley since it went 3D.
* **They haven't filled in the gaps that 3D requires to be filled in with NPCs**:  This is most apparently seen in the remakes of once 2D games, like BDSP.  Characters still behave in a very stiff, unnatural (and thus Uncanny Valley) manner in the 3D space, like walking on a grid, but not moving diagonally, so they only ever do 90 degree turns.  It's entirely possible to have diagonal and smoother movement, while still being on a grid.  Just take a look at RuneScape, or even in 2D games, Lufia:  The Ruins of Lore also has smooth movement on a grid.  Also, when it comes to cutscenes, we still have lots of things being implied to have happened, rather than being shown, which is more awkward in 3D.  For example, rival Barry bumping into the player; in the old 2D Gen 4 games, the characters are very stoic and don't budge an inch.  It was possible to have the player be nudged and shake, or even get pushed back a tile, but it's still easier to accept just a textbox ""THUD!"" in this abstraction.  However, in a 3D space, that same sort of stoic reaction to that situation once again comes across as Uncanny Valley.  The characters don't lose balance, or get knocked over, or anything, so it really does just come across as far too stiff in 3D.
* **The disconnect between characters moving their mouths, but having no voice acting**:  This is made worse when the cameras are up close to their face in the 3D games too, like Sword and Shield's intro being right up in Rose's face as he flails his arms and shouts about, but not a single peep is heard out of him.  Or how Piers is doing a whole concert at his gym, but all we hear are clothes ruffling and foot tapping sounds.  I believe even Black and White 2 had something more than this for Roxie.  With the 2D games, we never saw their mouths moving to begin with, due to how low-res the pixel art was, but even if we did, I think it'd be easier to accept this in 2D rather than 3D.
* **The colours of the characters and mon aren't as vibrant as the 2D sprites**:  This is more apparent if you directly compare the models with their 2D sprite counterparts from the older games.  Charizard is a less vibrant orange and looks washed out, Blastoise is a less vibrant blue, etc.

Now of course, this isn't to say they haven't had some good things in 3D.  Some of the new signature moves, like Cinderace's ability, do get lots of dynamism from the camera moving around and dynamic angles.  But the question ends up being, is it worth it, when everything else suffers.

Next I want to talk about an example of what Pokemon could still be if it stayed 2D.

My thought is, it could've gone higher resolution with the pixel art, and given us more detailed sprites and worlds.  The DS era saw them hybridizing 2D and 3D, with the characters being 2D sprites, and the environments being 3D.   I think that could've kept going, but the pixel art would've needed to go higher resolution, to match the smoothness of the polygons at higher resolutions.  There's an artist on DeviantArt named [SassySnivy](https://www.deviantart.com/speedxaaa), who sometimes does higher-res remakes of the old 2D Pokemon sprites, and it looks gorgeous!  I think it's an example of how Pokemon could've looked, if it stayed 2D Pixel art.  Here are some examples of their work below!

Which Paradox Pokémon Timeline forms you like more? Past or Future?,pokemon,"I'm just curious, which timeline Paradox Pokémon do you like more... 

Guess I'll go 1st: 

I chose the *Past Timeline*. I also like the designs of some pokémon from the future. But the the pokémon from the past are soooo cool!  I wish they would do much more. Like the other evolutions (ex: paradox forms for Bagon, Shelgon and even Mismagius...)

Two theories about The Treasure of Area Zero DLC,pokemon,"After a disappointing direct, I tried to collect all of the few informations available about the upcoming DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, so I formulated two theories about its narrative contents.

**The Teal Mask**. In the first part of the DLC, we're going to visit Kitakami and we're going meet new characters and Pokémon. Despite many people think otherwise, this first part of the DLC is strongly connected to the second one and the whole story: the new Pokémon Ogerpon is affected by Terastal even though it lives really far from Paldea. Then, there are two new important characters we're going to bring with us: Carmine and Kieran. 
Carmine is a little bit selfish, determined and hostile to people of other ethnic groups, like us. In spite of this, she has a soft spot for her little brother Kieran, who is shy and gentle.  
The three new Legendary Pokémon Okidogi, Munkidogi and Fezandipiti that protect the country from fiends and vicious beasts are based on the fairytale which inspired Tajiri for the creation of the three starters: Momotaro. 
Momotaro was a boy that was born from a peach that was found by an old lady. When he was old enough, but still a child, he gone on a battle against demons (Oni). He met three companions: a dog, a monkey and a feazant. 
Even in the trailer, we see a child with the Legendary Pokémon chasing off the fearsome Ogerpon. 
In nearly all cultures, the child is a symbol of youth, hope and humbleness. In many folklore fairytales (like Momotaro) the child that battles against monsters is seen as a growth opportunity. 
In ancient Arcadia, a Greek region, at the end of spring, sheperds thought to protect their flocks with newborn lambs from wolves' attacks by sending away someone who eaten the entrails of a sacrificed child away. We don't know if, for example, the child's blood was used to sprinkle the sheep and the lambs' barn so that wolves knew that there were humans (whom they fear) nearby, but the sense stays the same: sacrificing something,  someone important to *protect* one's resources. 
In Mesoamerican cultures, young victims of sacrifices were divinized.
If the hero of this Pokémon Momotaro was just Kievan?  In that case, he will step up with our help to fight against the malevolent presence of Ogerpon, the Pokémon buffed by Terastal. Thanks to him, Carmen will open to us.
 

**The Indigo Disk**. In the second part of the DLC, Arven, Nemona and Penny are probably going to return: you need to finish the main story to play it. You are going to study in Blueberry Academia, which bears a significant resemblance to Atlantis. Atlantis is the codename of Area Zero. Terapagos also is similar to this structure. In the form that they shown to us, Terapagos's silhouette looks like Paldea. The leaker Riddler Khu shown a picture of the movie King of Thorn. 
It is about humanity struggling against a virus which turns bodies to stone. Later on, it's discovered that this virus never existed, but a creature that fell from a meteor in Siberia called Medusa, who can make wishes come true, generated it. The whole DLC's codegame is ""Sudochi"". It isn't the fruit, but an asteroid. It seems that in this DLC we're going to uncover the true nature of Paldea's geological history. It looks like it's inspired also by the most ancient version of the World Turtle's myth, in which the turtle was the world. Will we face Terapagos in its true colors? Why has it got this form? One thing is sure: we need to unite and fight whatever threatens the world once again!","Two theories about The Treasure of Area Zero DLC After a disappointing direct, I tried to collect all of the few informations available about the upcoming DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, so I formulated two theories about its narrative contents.

IN LG/FR you can hear Pokemon cries if you stand still in a patch of grass for about a minute.,pokemon,"I just discovered something that's new to me.

I was just playing Leaf Green. I was doing something off to the side. My character was standing still in a grass patch and suddenly I heard this Pokemon cry sound.

(You really gotta listen for it.) I walk around near that spot and I run into the Pokemon that made that sound! Kind of a neat little feature.

If you already knew about this, that's great, but it was new to me so I thought I'd share.","IN LG/FR you can hear Pokemon cries if you stand still in a patch of grass for about a minute. I just discovered something that's new to me.

Which Pseudo Legendaries are actually usable in a play through?,pokemon,"When I was playing Scarlet, I picked up a Gibble fairly early on, and was able to fully evolve it into Garchomp before the end of the game, and thinking about it, it was the first time I was actually able to incorporate a pseduo into my team just playing normally.

Looking into it, I don't think there's many that you actually could use in a game , Even with the others you can obtain early  on in S/V, like Deino and Dreepy, they don't evolve to lvl 50, so you'll be weighed down by them a lot till just before the end game.

It seems like the majority of them are introduced way late into their debut game for you to be able to add them to  a team without major effort, and even if you could get a hold of them, a good few have absurdly high levels just to reach their mid stage. Granted, they do become very powerful at the final stage, but its a bit inconsistant how Beldum and Gibble evolve at lvl 20 and 24 respectively, the avergae seems to be 30, but then Dreep and Deino evolve at 50.

It seems the only viable options that don't hinder you for most the game are Garchomp and Metagross, since you could get gibble/gabite fairly early in S/M+ S/V and Beldum in S/M. Anyone else been able to use any other pseudos without causing pain?","Which Pseudo Legendaries are actually usable in a play through?

Why has breeding hacked mons become mainstream?,pokemon,"Is it just me, or is there an influx of people breeding for shinies of unreleased pokemon in this generation? For years now we've had to wait a good 6 months before bank/home updated to allow transfers of older mons into the newer games, yet for some reason, people don't like having to wait all of the sudden. Am I the weird one for being okay with waiting until home updates to breed for shinies that are transfer only? I just want to know why it seems so much more common this generation than in previous ones.","Why has breeding hacked mons become mainstream?

A bit of help for those struggling with Walking wake & Iron leaves raids,pokemon,"I see that some guys seems to struggle with these bad boys, so if it may help here's what I'm using for each of those.I'm not pretending that they're the best builds for these raids, and there are plenty of guides of skilled guys out there that you can check out.

During my 12 raids of each with these two, I never died and I hit like a truck. I'm only loosing when the other guys are dying.

I just put them to lvl 100, gave them full protein and bottle caps ; and they're all good, like really I didn't do anything crazier than that.

Or you can be the support guy with an Umbreon or a Blissey build, it is incredibly useful for everyone. Also don't forget to (always) use cheers.  
Depending who you're fighting, I'll also advise to put aside Greninja, Cinderace, Azumarill,  Meowscarada etc.. because they're not defensive enough.

PS : if you're scarlet and want an Iron hands, mp me I'll give you one with pleasure. I'll be available to trade in \~5 hours.

A Deep Dive into the Origins of Ting-Lu (tl;dr at the end),pokemon,"This will likely be the first of 4 posts, each detailing the origins of each member of the Treasure of Ruins. Yes, I know this is out of order. No, I don't care because Ting-Lu is my favorite and I will die on this hill.

First up, etymology. Ting-Lu's name is very straightforward, being the Wade-Giles romanization of its Chinese name, 鼎鹿. 鼎 refers to the cauldron on its head, while 鹿 means deer.

Out of the two, the more interesting one is the Cauldron. In ancient China, these cauldrons were originally used for cooking, but later developed into religious vessels of sacrifice and then eventually symbols of imperial authority. The green-ish color indicates that it is likely made up bronze, as most cauldrons were, though interestingly it has a round bottom and 3 legs, as opposed to a square bottom and 4 legs that were used by those of higher authority. One possible explanation is that the cauldron was made very early on, before the invention of the 4-legged cauldrons, when cauldrons were made almost exclusively by nobles and for them to show their power. The age of the cauldron is fitting, as Ting-Lu is the accumulated fear of people over thousands of years, which I will go over later.

Regarding their symbolism, Legend goes that an ancient king once ordered to make 9 massive cauldrons for 9 of its regions to celebrate the kingdom's wealth and engrave the kingdom's wisdom on it for future generations. They were so large that it took millions of people months to move them to the capital city once they were built. Over the years, as kingdoms were overthrown and capitals moved from place to place, the new kings would move the cauldrons with them, symbolizing the seize of political power. A person asking about the quality of the cauldrons were a direct indication that they would want to seize power. All 9 cauldrons were eventually lost.

Now that we understand the cauldron, why deer? My favorite answer is that this is a massive reference to the book *The Deer and the Cauldron* by Jin Yong (Louis Cha). Jin Yong was one of the most influential  writers in Chinese history who wrote almost exclusively in the Wuxia genre, which is mixture between historical fiction, fantasy, drama, and lots of martial arts. His books are characterized by rich references to traditional Chinese culture and values, combining factual history with mystical powers that roughly follow Chinese philosophy. *The Deer and the Cauldron* is his last Wuxia novel, and is the most unique of them all; instead of a traditional hero, the protagonist is a lazy and rebellious anti-hero with no knowledge of martial arts, akin to the Dark type in Pokemon. During his journey, he made friends with the “Heaven and Earth society”, a secret society aiming to overthrow the Qing dynasty and became their spy in the palace. Through wit, deception, and sheer luck, he became a powerful figure in the government known as the “Duke of Deer Cauldron”, assisting both the emperor and his underground friends. However, the emperor eventually found out about his falsity, and forced him to either remain loyal to the palace and kill the society, or be exiled and outcast forever. He chose the latter, bringing his entire wealth and 7 wives to a remote land in the South, never to be found again.

How does this relate to Ting-Lu? In the story, the cauldron symbolizes a king’s desire to seize absolute authority, while the deer symbolizes the common people helplessness to fight back. Together, they represent the struggles of Chinese (Han) people against the Manchu-led Qing dynasty. This coincides with how the cauldron in Ting-Lu is broken: the ancient Chinese rituals are replaced with foreign ones, breaking the traditional norms. It also explains the dex entries. In Scarlet, Ting-Lu is revealed to be the embodiment of fear, alluding to how Ancient Chinese history is one of many dynasties, each one ending violently either by a tyrant or an invader, each time bringing along great chaos that causes mass fear and panic. For Violet, Ting-Lu bringing its head to the ground can be seen as a metaphor for a dynasty crumbling, splitting the country into dozens of fragments just as how Ting-Lu splits the earth. Ting-Lu is the embodiment of the common people's fear of the upper-class authority of the government.

Finally, let's take a look at how the rest of this Pokemon supports my theory. Ting-Lu's ability, Vessel of Ruin, lowers special attack, just as how the iron grip of a strong authority restricts minds and willpower. The Dark type is self-evident, while the Ground type likely refers to land and the importance of land in political control. In Ancient Chinese philosophy, people reside on the ground and the gods reside in heaven (literally 'sky'). Control over land is direct control over political power, especially since Ancient China was very much an agricultural society, where people lived in farms and rarely moved beyond. Land is the people's home, and thus changes in Land, either politically or physically, results in massive fear of the unknown future as people could no longer sustain themselves with what was passed on by their elders. The emphasis on 'homeland' is a large part of Chinese values, as is patriotism. Another interpretation is that Ground is ancient and steady, like the rule of a powerful authority. This can be seen on Ting-Lu's body, where clear layers can be seen like those of mountains or sedimentary rock, even building up a mountain at the top. These layers can only be formed over long periods of time, where different climates creates different layers that build up on top of one another. Ting-Lu's chin also has what looks like to be stalactites, which can also only be formed over long periods of time. 

TL;DR: Ting-Lu references a famous novel of the Wuxia genre, where the cauldron and the deer symbolize the greed for power and the commoners' fear and helplessness in face of violence and chaos caused by those with authority.","A Deep Dive into the Origins of Ting-Lu (tl;dr at the end) This will likely be the first of 4 posts, each detailing the origins of each member of the Treasure of Ruins.

"If Pokémon Scarlet and Violet got balance patches, which Pokémon (including transfer only) do you think should get buffed/nerfed, how, and why?",pokemon,"Here's my buff suggestion for those curious: While Zamazenta is already good, it's really weird that its signature move Behemoth Bash does not scale with its Defense; like Body Press. It makes Behemoth Bash a direct copy of Behemoth Blade that can't take advantage of Zamazenta's stats and ability.

As for the nerf suggestion: Tatsugiri is just too strong in its Dondozo combo, despite having counters. For starters, the Commander ability should increase Dondozo’s stats by only 1 stage each, and those same stats should decrease when Tatsugiri faints while inside Dondozo.

Got blocked from doing random raids because of a glitch,pokemon,"So I was trying to do random Terra raids to not only build my dex a bit more, but also to level up my team.

[Hot Take]Old Pokémon Games aren't better than current ones,pokemon,"I've been playing Pokémon since the first gen, obviously, I was very young when I started so naturally, I have some nostalgic feelings for the older games, especially gen 3/4.

Now, I started playing Pokémon Heartgold again to have a savestate I could shiny hunt on. 50h in and I'm at the Indigo Plateau, and I'm struggling hard.

I've already caught Ho-Oh and if not for it, I wouldn't get past the first Trainer. You are incredibly underleveled if you don't grind before every single gym, ESPECIALLY if you switch pokémon here and there, because apparently Pokémon you catch in the Wild have to be 10lvl under the Trainer average. So either keep the same team from the start or have fun grinding.

You see my main complaint with this game yet? It's not that it's hard, it's just boring. I'm gonna have to continue putting time into grinding my pokémon up to Level 50 just for me to make it through the Elite 4. There's no skill involved in grinding. IDK why people constantly bring up old games like they weren't incredibly flawed too?

&#x200B;

My current team consists of:

Dratini Lvl 25

&#x200B;

Lapras Lvl 25

&#x200B;

Rhyhorn Lvl 35

&#x200B;

Gyrados Lvl 39

&#x200B;

Feraligatr lvl 40

&#x200B;

And Ho-Oh Lvl 55.

&#x200B;

Sure, the Difficulty in modern Pokémon games feels lacking, but isn't that because we all know all they types and weaknesses now? I can absolutely see why GameFreak / Pokémon doesn't listen to their fans that much, because we are absolutely biased towards the arguably worst games of the series.

&#x200B;

And I so far, without using medical items, I've only managed to get to the third trainer. And Barely so.

I'm seriously considering just stopping and putting the game away, since this already took a ridiculous amount of time to have half of the game through and now struggling this hard.","[Hot Take]Old Pokémon Games aren't better than current ones I've been playing Pokémon since the first gen, obviously, I was very young when I started so naturally, I have some nostalgic feelings for the older games, especially gen 3/4.

What other possible ancestors would you like to see in a potential Legends: Arceus Sequel? (Possible Spoilers?),pokemon,"Something that I want to discuss in PLA's anniversery a while back. The title is pretty self explanatory: What other potential ancestors would you guys like to see in another Legends game?

One ancestor I would like to see is one for [Viola](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Viola). Perhaps they love to draw or take pictures (depending on how long ago the game would take place) of various Pokemon they had spotted - And could even give the player a photo of a rare Pokemon.

[Koga](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Koga) is another charater I want to see a potential ancestor of, given that Beni mentioned the ancient ways on the ninja. It would be nice to see another ninja character in the past who has more connections to a contemporary ninja character.

A character based on [Silver](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Silver_(game)) would also be interesting, though their teams would not take inspiration from Silver's. Instead I imagine such a character using mainly Ground types, like Dugtrio and Rhydon, as a callback to Giovanni, and highlight his relation to Silver. They might even be seen starting what would later become Team Rocket.

I would also like to see a [Cara Liss](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Cara_Liss) ancestor in the less distant past, where they recently invented fossil resurrection. Unfortunately, they would have a *lot* of misunderstandings on their craft, resulting in previous fossil Pokemon gaining... less than ideal new forms (by anatomical standards).

My final idea for a Legends character isn't an ancestor, but I still want to include her here: I want to see [Liza](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Tate_and_Liza) get the Ingo treatment and be sent back to the past with no memories. (After all, the distortions separated one set of twins, so why not another >:)) I like to imagine that version of Liza being discovered by some friendly bamboo harvesters one night, who then take her in as their own. She would also end up in a position of high power - not exactly a princess, more like one of PLA's Wardens. And she would be seen outside on nights with a cresent moon, shedding tears as if she was reminiscing an forgotten friend from long ago...

But what about you guys? What other characters would you like to see in another Legends title?","What other possible ancestors would you like to see in a potential Legends: Arceus Sequel?

Anyway to guarantee a Leafstone before getting to Kanto?,pokemon,"Hey everyone! I recently started playing SoulSilver for the first time ever. I played Silver and Crystal to death as a kid so am pretty familiar with most mechanics in the game. However, I am wondering if there's a way to ""guarantee"" getting a Leafstone before facing the Elite Four? I know Picnicker Gina will call you if she finds one, but I first registered her number around 3 hours into my game, and I am currently 18 hours in. In Silver/Crystal, the amount of calls you would receive from in-game people was pre-determined. So if I deleted all phone numbers except for Gina/Allen/Tully, it was guaranteed I would get a stone of my choosing sooner rather later. I have looked through the pokegear and don't see any way to get rid of numbers. I have not accepted any phone numbers from people other than the ""stone givers"" and the numbers that the game makes you take. Can I delete Lyra/Daycare man, etc numbers? Is there something I should be doing that I'm not? Or is this just a very intense waiting game?","Anyway to guarantee a Leafstone before getting to Kanto? Hey everyone!

"Instead of BOTW, I wish Pokemon was more like Yakuza.",pokemon,"As a player who is disappointed with SV but really enjoyed PLA, I think a modern Pokemon game's single player would be stronger if it emphasized side quests that help expand the game's world. Not that BOTW doesn't do that, but when we hear BOTW the assumption is ""wide open sandbox, non-linear progression."" 

The Yakuza series is famous for its involved side quests, both for comedic purposes but also delivering some pretty impactful side stories as well. I was thinking of PLA and getting side quests that featured Pokemon and humans being brought together, and that helping establish the modern-day relationships of Pokemon and people. Little side stories would really go a long way to add content to these empty cities/towns, and help flesh out the people of the region.

I'll probably get blasted by the SV community, but I just feel like these games failed ""BOTW Pokemon"" experience people expected, playing in this big empty sandbox without the tools and toys of a Zelda game. Hyrule is a setting 100 years after a near apocalyptic event, yet it feels more alive than Paldea.

Volcarona and drought,pokemon,"I think Volcarona would be a good fit for the ability drought"". He is a sort of embodiment of the sun. He is literally the sun pokemon. His pokedex entries read as follows.

"" A sea of fire engulfs the surroundings of their battles, since they use their six wings to scatter their ember scales."" 

"" Thought to be an embodiment of the sun, it appeared during a bitterly cold winter and saved Pokémon from freezing.""

"" When volcanic ash darkened the atmosphere, it is said that Volcarona's fire provided a replacement for the sun.""

"" As it flies, it scatters its flaming scales. It was feared by ancient people, who referred to it as “the rage of the sun.”  
 Not only does drought fit his lore I think it fits his gameplay. Volcarona is so close to be good but he needs that something to make him better. Also we need more options for sunlight setup Pokémon. Not to mention is weakness to stealth rocks would make it hard for you to just swithch into him whenever you want to get sunlight up.

I had a friend who said that ""Volcarona is like Unova's Tyranitar. At least defensibly Tyranitar typing sucks but he is so good he makes it work and you have to play around that"" Well one thing that makes playing around Tyranitar weakness is his sand stream ability.","Volcarona and drought I think Volcarona would be a good fit for the ability drought"".

But i played every game / gen to this day with Scarlet/Violet and if we are honest, 3rd gen really is the best of pokemon 

- Only gen where we have 2 distincts team fighting and both are included in the other game (Team Magma is in Saphire or AS for exemple)
- One of the best trio starter
- Best post game content in the days and even with the ORAS remake (Delta episode)
- Secret Bases
- Pokemon Contest
- The Regi-trio is by far the best trio within all game (i’m waiting on S/V to see maybe)

And with gen 6 we got Soaring with Latios/Latias and megas? The only thing that Hoenn is missing is character customization like in X/Y

Bad Night Pokemon Hunting,pokemongo,"I live in the suburbs and don't have a car. So I take my dog and we walk around the apartment complexes around ours. 

I picked up PoGo in December to help me walk more. Since I was starting from nothing, I've been slowly building endurance and walking more and more. 

I take breaks and sit at picnic tables or benches around the neighborhoods so I can rest, catch mon, and then go on to walk the next leg of my journey. 

Last night I was sitting on a bench outside the leasing office of an apt complex I frequent (two stops at the entrance and higher than the normal mon spawns) and two cops showed up. They said someone complained and they were checking if I'm ok. I told them what I was doing and asked if I'm not supposed to be there and they just kinda rolled their eyes and said we just came to see if you're ok bc someone called. 

Since they didn't seem to care, I thought it was fine. Well I had a cig and went to leave when more people showed up. I saw two old people talking to the cops, so clearly the ones that complained, and then a leasing office person showed up too. I was leaving so they all followed me and she was like ""you can't be there, you're scaring the residents, it's private property"" so I said ok and left. 

It's fine. It sucks but the neighborhood next to it also has a bench and there's a gym at that entrance, so whatever. But it's been bothering me since. I feel like I did something wrong and I just feel shitty. 

Why are people so annoying? I walk by with my golden, sit on a bench outside, and then leave. I don't bother anyone. What is scary about a 40+ overweight lady with a golden catching pokemon?

I just feel sad.","Bad Night Pokemon Hunting I live in the suburbs and don't have a car. So I take my dog and we walk around the apartment complexes around ours.

Do you have a friend that …,pokemongo,"is from a different country and likes pinning your gift before Scatterbug is added to the game?

I made a friend from Leekduck’s Raid now page almost a year ago. We send/open gifts with sticker daily, and later on I noticed that every time I send a gift which from a pokestop that I haven’t sent her before, she pins the gift. Then, I always send her gift from a new stop and she started to do the same thing, sending me gift from a new stop almost every time. She’s from Japan and I’m in Canada. I like pinning her gifts too. 

When I go to a new place, I will clear my gift inventory to make sure I have new gifts to send her.

I wonder if anyone has similar stories?","Do you have a friend that … is from a different country and likes pinning your gift before Scatterbug is added to the game?

So I don't know how other players have found the game recently, but for me it's been insanely disappointing. Each event seems worse and worse, and every update Niantic pushes out just seems to add more bugs or performance issues that never get addressed. To top it off, tomorrow is Elite raid day...

&#x200B;

I reluctantly plan to be out for it. Despite how poor the game has felt lately, and despite how I hate what these elite raids stand for: a raid that blocks a gym for 24 hours, which you have to take part in in-person and requires coordinating with other players without the ability to remote invite from afar. Something pretty much impossible for a small (almost non-existant) community like mine. I've tried using Campfire to arrange raids in the past, but because it's still closed off to the majority of players, nobody where I live (in the middle of nowhere) seems to bother using it. It also lags my phone out, so instead, despite the fact I have Elite raids spawned fairly close by, I have to coordinate with friends through Discord and travel 10 miles away to have **any** hope of taking part. Even then, I don't know if we'll have enough players, since there's only 3 or 4 others who I know are definitely taking part.

&#x200B;

I don't mind the travelling part really; probably since I'm used to all the extra travelling and subsequent expense this game causes by now, and honestly it is at least a little better this time since they properly advertised the elite raid day. Afterall, I heard absolutelty nothing about the last elite raid day until I saw the raid eggs pop up. But after the Hoenn tour... I just feel less and less motivation to play this game. Not to rant about that too much, but 2 shinies is what I managed - this was after travelling **even further afield** (20ish miles?) to a town that has a much higher spawn density and number of players. I played for the full 8 hours the first day, caught god knows how many Pokemon with my Pokeball plus, hatched a bunch of eggs, and did a bigger bunch of raids. I even kept an eye on the ""journal"" log to see whether any shinies fled whilst being caught on auto with the Pokeball Plus... nothing. Just the one Pokemon I got from a research task (a pokemon I'd already had shiny), and the kinda cool, kinda dissappointing wild shiny Latias... which I also already had one of. None of the new shinies. None of the regional egg ones. Not the much vaunted shiny Groudon I really wanted, or another shiny Kyogre (I got very lucky with a trade a few years back at least). Not even any of the decent shinies I already had, but was still hunting like crazy.

&#x200B;

Honestly, I've never had good luck with the tour days. Hell, both previous tours I either broke my phone, or had catastrophic tech problems - feel like the tour events are a curse for me at this point. But this time I seriously went all out... and that's all I get? I spent money on the Jirachi questline thinking I'd at least get 2 extra incenses for the weekend (since they did list that as a bonus), only to be stung because I forgot they love to make the tour questlines absurdly long and tedious, and literally impossible to finish quickly. I'm hardly surprised that for the third Tour event in a row I completely failed to get a shiny Unown, something I've been hunting since the beginning... and yet they make it a requirement for the dex completion to get every Unown as a shiny?! Then let's not forget how they didn't put out any real info until the last minute, generously made the event ""free""... but then took away the 8 bonus raid passes that usually come with the event, to force players to buy premiums or remote passes in the shop. I honestly feel the only reason they made it free was so they had the excuse to lower shiny rates etc., since ""it's free, so people can't complain"". And let's also not forget how bad the Las Vegas players had it, because the location locked ticketed events always seem to be a catastrophe (plus didn't the game ticket cost like $70 with all the added extras, before even having to buy plane tickets & accommodation?!).

&#x200B;

...And with regards to this latest update notification, is all of that supposed to be part of their ""renewed commitment to bolstering Pokemon Go's in-person experience""? Because from what I can see, they've just been making the game worse, regardless of whether you play in-person or from home. I mean for crying out loud, if you want players to play and raid in person, for one thing **actually give more XL rare candies from doing raids in person**. That was meant to be a thing for a while now, but in-person raids still **almost never** drop them.

&#x200B;

Honestly, I'm just... so done with this company, and this game right now. I've had problems with Niantic for years... and I mean of course I have, since I'm a rural player. It felt like things might finally improve a bit when they added the Coronavirus concessions, because they actually made the game more accessible. But they just seem intent on stripping all of that back and then some. And that's precisely why this update message worries me.

&#x200B;

Before this elite Raid day event, I practically stopped playing for 2 full weeks. And you know what? I actually had fun, because I wasn't playing this game. I still play occassionally because it's a weak excuse to get exercise and meet up with friends, but honestly... even if tomorrow goes well, I'm honestly considering just quitting altogether.

GBL Rewards Trash,pokemongo,"Not sure who needs to see this, but I can’t be the only one frustrated by this. You play through five rounds of GBL:

-ANOTHER Meditite
-ANOTHER Skarmory
-ANOTHER Sinnoh stone (WHY?!?)

-ANOTHER Wingull


I cannot be the only one baffled by this. Maybe an incubator, some gimmighoul coins, or even a random amount of poke balls, maybe even the occasional bonus battle, a sun stone perhaps, lure module….LITERALLY anything other than the trash completion prizes they constantly and repetitively give to players. 

Of all the Pokémon they say you can get, I consistently get the same rotating menagerie of instantly transferred nonsense. I don’t need more skarmory candies or an unending amount of sinnoh stones that I have no use for at this point in my gameplay, like seriously let me go out of my way to find a rhydon to use it on, it is seriously infuriating.

Of all the things to do in PoGo, I enjoy battling. It’s not about the prizes whatsoever, I’d greatly appreciate an unlimited battle cap and stardust as opposed to literally ANY of the so called completion prizes.

Elite raids are an amazing feature and the community overreacts every time they come around.,pokemongo,"Yes they require you to do in groups with no remote raids. Yes they are harder than regular raids and require more people. No you don’t have a community to play with. We get it.

Do you expect Niantic to make content only for people who play remote or don’t have communities people to play with?(they do)

Or do you expect Niantic to not make content for people who do have communities and like to play in person?

Almost anyone can agree this game is a lot more fun to play when you have people to play with, so why do we bash events designed to bring us together. 

I understand a lot of you are rural and it’s harder for you to find groups or coordinate with others and I feel that, Niantic should do something for those people. 

However it still stands that a vast majority of you live in cities with Pokémon Go communities that you haven’t gone to look for or attempted to participate in at all. There is no way all of you are rural. 

Every elite raid event, thousands of people go out and enjoy playing with people in their communities and it’s brought a lot of people together and made the game generally more enjoyable for most. You meet people to trade with and coordinate with, maybe even some GBL. It’s a genius feature for bringing people together which is a main goal for Niantic and so far it seems to have worked. 

TLDR: A lot of you complain about elite raids but have made 0 effort to join your local communities, most of you aren’t rural, and Elite Raids have brought thousands of people together to play the game enhancing the game experience considerably. The game is more fun with others so why so much hate on events meant to help with that.","Elite raids are an amazing feature and the community overreacts every time they come around.

I understand a lot of you are rural and it’s harder for you to find groups or coordinate with others and I feel that, Niantic should do something for those people. 

However it still stands that a vast majority of you live in cities with Pokémon Go communities that you haven’t gone to look for or attempted to participate in at all. There is no way all of you are rural. 

Every elite raid event, thousands of people go out and enjoy playing with people in their communities and it’s brought a lot of people together and made the game generally more enjoyable for most. You meet people to trade with and coordinate with, maybe even some GBL. It’s a genius feature for bringing people together which is a main goal for Niantic and so far it seems to have worked. 

TLDR: A lot of you complain about elite raids but have made 0 effort to join your local communities, most of you aren’t rural, and Elite Raids have brought thousands of people together to play the game enhancing the game experience considerably. The game is more fun with others so why so much hate on events meant to help with that.",elite raids are an amazing feature and the community overreacts every time they come around,elite raids are an amazing feature and the community overreacts every time they come around yes they require you to do in groups with no remote raids yes they are harder than regular raids and require more people no you dont have a community to play with we get it do you expect niantic to make content only for people who play remote or dont have communities people to play withthey do or do you expect niantic to not make content for people who do have communities and like to play in person almost anyone can agree this game is a lot more fun to play when you have people to play with so why do we bash events designed to bring us together i understand a lot of you are rural and its harder for you to find groups or coordinate with others and i feel that niantic should do something for those people however it still stands that a vast majority of you live in cities with pokémon go communities that you havent gone to look for or attempted to participate in at all there is no way all of you are rural every elite raid event thousands of people go out and enjoy playing with people in their communities and its brought a lot of people together and made the game generally more enjoyable for most you meet people to trade with and coordinate with maybe even some gbl its a genius feature for bringing people together which is a main goal for niantic and so far it seems to have worked tldr a lot of you complain about elite raids but have made  effort to join your local communities most of you arent rural and elite raids have brought thousands of people together to play the game enhancing the game experience considerably the game is more fun with others so why so much hate on events meant to help with that,15

"Digimon World: Next Order, Switch & PC Versions- General Discussion & Information Thread",digimon,"https://preview.redd.it/mn16ywa24nja1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9a2b69a40583d1d5325903d009c88b9a9c757197

With the Steam version out, Switch physical versions shipping, & Switch digital versions about to come out country by country, seemed about the right time for a Digimon World: Next Order thread.

The game is out February 22nd worldwide.

&#x200B;

Digimon World: Next Order is a PC & Switch port of the PS4 version of Next Order (called International Edition in Japan.) The 2017 PS4 port was a heavily upgraded port of the 2016 Vita game, which had a focus on upgrading the look of the game, and lessening bugs and glitches (along with adding new content.)

&#x200B;

The PC & Switch versions should be near identical to the PS4 version of the game as far as overall content goes, with the main differences being two tweaks:

A Beginner Mode- which has enemy difficult reduced.

Dashing- The player character can now run, which is 1.4x faster than the standard walking, which should speed-up gameplay quite a bit.

&#x200B;

Content that was added later to Next Order on PS4 should be there from the beginning, once you can unlock it.

The game has 232 Digimon in it.

Digimon World: Next Order is a single player game.

&#x200B;

The store pages are up on digital, the time when purchases go up may change based on where you live, so be aware:

Steam- [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1530160/Digimon\_World\_Next\_Order/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1530160/Digimon_World_Next_Order/)

&#x200B;

Physical Switch copies are in the midst of shipping, and Bandai has said physical stock will be limited.

The Bandai Store is including a beanie with pre-orders- [https://store.bandainamcoent.com/digimon-world-next-order/](https://store.bandainamcoent.com/digimon-world-next-order/)

&#x200B;

Pre-Order bonus items, if available where you purchase are:

Omegamon Digivolution Item

Imperialdramon Paladin Mode Digivolution Item

Parameter Boost Set- HP Chip Mini x2, MP Chip Mini x2, Strength Chip Mini x2, Stamina Chip Mini x2, Speed Chip Mini x2, Wisdom Chip Mini x2

1. All 3 pokemon have no x4 weaknesss and only three x2 weaknesses each, and none are weak to fire/water/grass
   1.  Fire/Grass:weak to flying, poison, and rock

3. All 3 pokemon have atleast two 1/2 resistances and atleast one 1/4 resistance, and each quadruple resists one of their own typings

   2. Grass/Water: 1/4x damage from water

"still kinda getting the hang of the series. thoughts on virtual pets, Next Order, VB",digimon,"Hey again!

Just wanted to talk about my experience with Digimon and what I'm looking to do next, could use some guidance

Cyber Sleuth was my first attempt to get into the series a number of years ago. I actually liked the game a lot but got really confused at managing and collecting Digimon. Some would evolve into each other's evolution lines (from what little I know about them) and I'd start losing like, 'identity' of who was who. I eventually tried it again at some point but gave up again for the same reasons.

Meanwhile I picked up what I think is the Ver. 20th virtual pet. I got the yellow one because I heard something about a special Gabumon egg, and with how little I know of Digimon, I *do* know that I'm a big fan of Gabumon, Garurumon, and Metal Garurumon.

I'm an overthink-er and a worry-er, so I didn't last TOO long with the virtual pet, but I did enjoy my time with it and thought it was pretty awesome. Tamagotchis are mega nostalgic for me. Hell, I even had a *Godzilla* one as a kid. I'm a massive tokusatsu nut, so that was right up my alley. (I also missed the whole idea of ""making mistakes is part of the fun because it influences which Digimon you get"")

Then, because I'm a massive tokusatsu nut, I got a Vital Bracelet back when they weren't even a thing in the US yet (where I live). I got a couple DIM cards (Kuuga, Ultraman Z, and Sevenger) and basically used one of each character.

By the time I finished with the cards, I realized I was losing interest in the VB because it kinda wasn't what I'd hoped it would be.

The daily exercises didn't really seem.. I dunno, accurate forms of exercise I guess. And I knew the thing worked best as a step-counter which did give me some motivation to go walking, but having to repeatedly scan my phone (it has a NFC in it) to get them to battle got really old really fast. Sure the battling can get a little grindy on the virtual pet too, but at least you're just pressing a button and not having to scan a thing that works maybe 95% of the time.

I had actually already bought the US Vital Hero with Gabumon (AND a Gammamon card) by the time my interest fizzled out completely. I do still have all of this stuff and am always thinking of starting it up again, but the somewhat annoying grind of battling always takes me back out of it.

Plus I just found out the apps for both my toku characters and Digimon are apparently closing this month, soooooo.. there goes that, I guess.

Life went on, and the past couple weeks I started thinking about Digimon again. The last Pokemon Direct kinda killed my Pokemon interest for the time being, and a discord server I hang out in all the time is always talking up Digimon (that's where I discovered Gammamon, who is *adorable*), so I figured I'd give it another shot with Next Order.

Next Order's been fun, and the subreddit's helped a lot with figuring things out (along with MrW01FY's tutorial videos which are invaluable), but I think I've just got so much going on in my day-to-day that I'm getting burned out on big games like this. 

So I'm thinking about shelving it for the time being (for big games, I send myself an email detailing where I left off so that I can pick right back up in the future and it's been incredibly helpful) and going right back to the Ver. 20th. 

The way I see it, the Ver. 20th. should be fun to add to my daily life (especially with the whole ""don't worry about making mistakes"" thing), and it's simple enough that it won't require a ton of brainpower.

So I mean, I guess I'm veering toward just re-activating that one and yeah. But I do still give the Vital Bracelet some thought, even though the scan-grinding and having to get some walking done every day can be a little daunting. Buuut the Ver. 20th. is also a couple years old by now (I think?), so I also wonder if something's out there that might be more my speed. Although if I'm looking for a simplistic experience, maybe the Ver. 20th. is the best thing. *Although* I know the Ver. 20th works best if you raise two Digimon at once, and I'm wondering if I'd be better off with a device of the same style that only has you raise one at once.

I dunno.

There's my rambling though! Any thoughts would be appreciated and thank you for reading!","still kinda getting the hang of the series. thoughts on virtual pets, Next Order, VB And that got me thinking, the same probably has to be true for the Gym leaders.

Sprite Art for D-Brigade Expansion (Jungle Themed),digimon,,"Sprite Art for D-Brigade Expansion (Jungle Themed) So I've been playing Pokemon a long time, pretty much as long as there's been Pokemon I've been playing it. I've been imposing a self set of rules because of both how easy pokemon is, especially once you know the tricks, and because of a few things I've noticed. 

Skip this paragraph if you just want the rules,but one thing I've noticed when I play Pokemon games is that I always end the game with so much money and so much healing items, and I started to think about why. I think that being able to walk back to a pokemon center and heal, is too convenient, so nobody ever wastes their super potion on a route or in a gym, when they can just go back to the pokemon center and spent a grand total of 45 seconds healing all their mons and getting back to the spot they were at before. The only time the player is really pushed is if they are in caves, but modern caves really don't hold up to OG caves like Mt. Silver, RBY Victory Road, RSE Victory Road, even Mt. Moon (say what you will about Mt. Moon but I have vivid childhood memories of getting lost and feeling like it took forever to navigate). But since nothing ever stops the player from just heading back to the PC whenever, a large chunk of the game like healing items, and even money have less of an impact. 

Alright sorry for the exposition here's the rules I use when I play Pokemon games, just to add a little spice.

-Once you enter a route/gym/hideout, you may not leave that route/gym/hideout through the same way you came in. You have begun a journey forward, go somewhere that isn't where you came from. This means no casual walks back to the Pokemon Center when your 1st mon gets poisoned by Bug Catcher Arnie's Weedle or whatever.

-Save before you enter a route/gym/hideout, if you black out on the route reload the save. Blacking out = no punishment aside from losing a trivial amount of money that you weren't going to spend anyway. Reloading the save means having to refight all the trainers. Now there are stakes. It's like a gentle Nuzlocke. This means that you need to actually prepare for your journey down the next route by buying and using healing items.

-No avoiding wild battles via running away or repels. I think that being able to avoid wild pokemon removes the struggle and adventure aspect of journeying down a route to the next town. The journey wasn't memorable because you avoided everything except two trainers. But when you have to battle every wild Mon, and your PP is running out, and the wild mons keep whittling your health down and tossing the occasional status effect, that's when you feel the struggle, the danger, the adventure of it all. Making it to the next city with one paralyzed pokemon left at 15 HP? Now that was a memorable journey.

-Set mode on. I feel like this doesn't need explaining but being able to always switch to a water type when you know a fire type is coming is hella cheat codes. If anyone complains about how easy the game is but plays with switch mode on, you deserve to get turned into a Shedinja without Wonder Guard.

-No using free heals on routes. This one is a bit minor but some games have the convenient nurse right outside the cave who heals all your pokemon. Don't use it. Or if you think that's a bit harsh, cause sometimes they have a long route, followed by a nurse before a cave, and then another route after the cave, then just limit yourself to once per route.

These are some rules that add some fun to my playthroughs, feel free to comment yours I'd love to read them.

Some doubts about the Digi-Battle/Hyper Colosseum card game,digimon," Hello,  
 

since the new Digimon card game reignited my love for Digimon, I tried  to retreive the Digi-Battle cards I (tried to) play with when I was a  child. Back then I just had a bunch of cards with no ruleset (I have no  idea how it happened that I owned those cards), and I had to look for  the rules with a 56K connection and I asked a friend of my dad to  translate them from english to italian lol. So, it was kind of a mess  but it mostly worked.  
 

Anyway, I tried to retrieve the rules today and I found lots of  discussions on the internet, about how the game was broken especially  comparing the japanese and the english version, and I have some  questions I still hadn't quite found an answer for. I hope there's still  someone who knows this game here, since I saw a couple of old threads.  
 

I'll use these three cards as reference for the first question: 

https://preview.redd.it/pb3k1p8mlzma1.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aaff7e0339f94a6f2921be6ddd9d6841a06dc762

 1) Vaccine - Data - Virus. In the Digimon canon it should be supposed to  be sort of rock-paper-scissor, while as far as I got, in the japanese  game it's A-B-C loosely tied to attributes, but A(against ""vaccine"")  attacks are always the strongest and C(against ""virus"") the lowest, but C  attacks set the opponent's attack to 0.  
 

This doesn't really look like rock-paper-scissor to me: C/virus Digimon  basically always have an attack of 0 unless some specific option card  (or rare digimon effect) is able to change this, right? Am I getting  something wrong? Is there some counterbalance that makes C/Viruses  stronger on some other aspect? (For example easier/cheaper  digivolutions)  
 

In the western version, instead, there's nothing that sets opponent's  attacks to 0, but the weakest attack, called ""Defend"", has something  different yet also weird:  
 \- For Virus Digimon, the Defend attack is the one against Vaccines (correctly so)  
 \- For Data Digimon, the Defend attack is the one against Viruses (correctly so)  
 \- For Vaccine Digimon, the Defend attack is the one against other Vaccines (???)  
 

While in the JPN version Virus were the weakest, now it seems Data  digimon are the weakest: no-one ever uses their weakest attack agains  them. Again, is there something I'm missing about balance?  
 

2) This wiki -> [https://wikimon.net/Digital\_Monster\_Card\_Game](https://wikimon.net/Digital_Monster_Card_Game) says that there was also a format called **""Ultimate Battle Level** 「アルティメットバトルレベル"", described as ""An advanced format in which each player plays three Digimon at once, instead of the usual one.""  
 Since I'm kinda tempted to improve the game taking inspiration from another game (called [Air, Land, and Sea](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/247367/air-land-sea))  that I think would fit quite well, I'm surprised to see there was  indeed a format that used three Digimon at once (like I would like the  change the game into). I couldn't find any info about that whatsoever,  though; I even Google-translated the japanese link that was supposed to  explain that format, but it described the regular japanese rules  instead. Do you know anything about this format with 3 Digimon at once?  
 

3) How do these card work? Why are they put face down on Power Port,  while the other option cards don't say so? (Also the italian version of  ""To Champion"" says you take your Champion from your Deck, instead than  from your hand... the translation really sucks, ugh). For the ""To  Champion"" card, what do you do with the downgraded Ultimate/Mega? Is it  sent offline, or in your hand, or what?

[Digimon World: Next Order]Chapter 2 stat farming method,digimon,"Best part of this method is that it doesn't require end-game/post-game content to do so. However, you do need lv4 item shop upgrade(for max tent 10x, although 3x or 6x tent works, just would not be as effective as 10x tent), and lv2 sender upgrade, to be able to go to these places. This makes it possible for you to max your digimon(apart from HP/MP) and be ready to crush everything in your path with ease.  


4 required things you need to set this up + optional:  
\*Lv4 Item Shop upgrade(for 10x tent usages)  
\*Lv2 Sender upgrade(for Hinterland locations unlock)  
\*Desync'd newborn digimon with helper at about 4kish stats to be safe to be able to help train your newborn digimon  
\*Tamer skill ""Sleep Care"" - must have as to not rest as often - otherwise you only recover 10% fatigue instead of 20% fatigue - if you don't have this tamer skill, use Angemon in hospital to recover fatigue instead - every time you rest, one in hour game is gone from training  
\*\*Lv5 Resturant(for best food boosting stats, or you can just do 500 hp/mp one)\*\* \*\*Optional\*\* \*\*Expensive, but best and easiest\*\*  


Abusing tent to rest fatigue, and autopilots for Serph's food, the one with 1500 hp/mp or 500 hp/mp and you'll be set for end game/post game. Bear in mind, this only works FOR Rookie stage, not in-training I / in-training II / Champion / Ultimate / Mega / Ultra(Gold Mega).  


First, we want to go to Wargrowlmon(orange) lv 35 and farm it until max STA, the WIS/SPD will be capped at 6200ish, meanwhile STR will be capped at 8800ish. Location: Faulty Ex Machina Hinterland via Sender and go towards East Coast. There's a solo Wargrowlmon(orange) lv 35 RIGHT there by borders, which you can reset very fast.  


Afterwards, go to Weregaurumon(black) lv 45, and farm it until max WIS/SPD. Location: Bony Resort Hinterland via Sender and go towards Night Church, and it's very small room which you can reset very fast.  


As for STR, you can abuse tent: As in go in tent and break it, to respawn digimon, instead of running back and forward. Location: Faulty Ex Machina Hinterland via Sender and go towards Pathfork Island. Go to Metalgreymon(Blue) lv 38. It should max your STR.  


Also, DO NOT sleep OR rest the fatigue OR eat the meals UNLESS it's about 10 seconds BEFORE the hour ends upon them asking to sleep/rest/eat. Reason being that sleep resets the fatigue, meals - if bought in resturants - reduces fatigue, so it's okay to keep pushing them until 5-10 seconds before hour ends. However, do make sure fatigue doesn't go beyond 70-80%. Only IF you are getting fatigue right before sleep or meal, by all means, go ahead and push them but only right BEFORE they get 100% fatigue or 10 seconds before the hour, which will result in training failure - and in some cases, reduce their lifespan. Example: 12:00 and 18:00 is when they get hungry, ignore their hunger until 12:50 and 18:50 respectively, and autopilot back to city and teleport to resturant right away.  


Another thing to point out, to be as effective as you can be with timing, always use teleport between areas in city(using menu button), no running around in city, and make sure to press menu button in game if you want to pause, so that the in-game clock won't tick. Buy a lot of portable potties and autopilots, along with HP/MP/Remedy recovery disks. When you do get back to city, ALWAYS fix your tent immediately to be able to keep resetting the area/rest fatigue.

Digimon You Want To See In A New Game,digimon,"So, I was thinking recently about what Digimon could appear in a new Digimon game. Whether it’s older Digimon that haven’t appeared in a while, or Digimon that are newer, and haven’t gotten a chance to be in a console game yet, I’m curious to see what Digimon others want to see in a new game.

I’ll start with a couple I’d like to see (because there are a lot of Digimon I’d love to see in a new Digimon game).

Vemmon, Herissmon, Blucomon, Tinmon, Imperialdramon Fighter Mode (Black), Reapermon, Gammamon, Angoramon, Jellymon, Ebidramon, Vorvomon, and Jazamon.","Digimon You Want To See In A New Game (~~for some reason I cannot seem to post an image? Sorry about that, find the referenced images linked below!~~ I realize now it is way past 5pm UTC \^\^; For some reason I thought UTC=PST, my bad! Since this isn't a finished product artwork and more of a behind the scenes thing, leaving it up, but admin, if not okay please feel free to take it down).

I'm working on creating an enamel pin series of Floofelutions -- floofy eeveelutions -- (which see my comment below if you'd like to pre-order via my Kickstarter; it ends tomorrow, Saturday, March 11 at 11am CST!) and I thought it'd be fun to show you the behind the scenes view of what it's like after you've finished the artwork and are working with a manufacturer to create the pins!

I am working with hard enamel pins, which means not only is the enamel (the color filling) hard in texture, the entire pin is made up of a metal base. My two favorites I use are either gold metal or black nickel.

Picture creating pins sort of like stained glass; everywhere there's an enclosed space is a single fill enamel color. But as you can see in some of my examples there's colors layered on top of those colors (i.e. Sylveon, Espeon's head gem) which is what is then called ""screenprinting"" where you pay to have an extra color printed on top of that base enamel color.

Then there's the 'cutouts' and 'recessed metal' bit of a pin. Cutouts are self-explanatory: they're the parts that the manufacturer will literally cut out so there's a hole in the design, i.e. Espeon's tail. Then there's 'recessed metal' which is where the metal is recessed -- i.e. lower than the rest of the design -- to create a depth but not having to fully cut it out. This works for super small areas where a cutout isn't feasible.

I also strive to make sure my designs are uniform across the board, which given how much the Eeveelutions can vary because of their ears or tails is pretty tricky! So you can see that all of them were measured in the paw-to-paw location as that stays the same for this design to make sure they are all kept within proportion of each other.

Check out four of my designs below and hope you enjoyed this behind the scenes look! Be sure to check out my comment if you're interested in getting your own! ♥

A curious child [OC],digimon,,"A curious child [OC] TL;DR: 30 year old man relives his childhood dreams last felt with Pokemon Yellow, share your love for the game and what you like the most about it. 

I wanted to share a little story,

Im a 30 y/o man (awaiting an ASD diagnosis) who has played almost every pokemon main game so far, ever since platinum I just stopped enjoying them after a few hours, games became easier and easier and I just didn't get the same feeling from them in the same I did from Yellow, Blue, Gold and Crystal (I plaited them from day of release too) I got Scarlet on day of release and fell in love with it, the sheer idea that I spent 20+ hours playing before getting one badge just because I let the game take me where it wanted, trying to explore everything I could before getting to the school, once I'd done the school part of the story I discovered picnic shiny hunting and went around catching pokemon, exploring and shiny hunting, proceeded with the games story to boost my jumpluff so that it was strong enough to tank moves and put pokemon to sleep, I must have caught half a box of Shiny pokemon, all with only 1 badge, this is truly what this game has to offer! This is what the pokemon series needed to become what it used to be, I felt like a kid again. 

My switch needed to be repaired because my joycons weren't working properly and the repair team messed up, said my switch was fine and factory reset it, all my time and experience just gone...

...only difference is that this time my daughter had her birthday and we got her a switch with pokemon Violet, she fell in love with it the way I did when I played pokemon yellow, I decided to keep booting new games until we both had all three starters, I think found out how to get false swipe and raced my way through to the tera scyther, I was determined to get back to where I was, I got the scyther, obtained false swipe and then I have continued on from where I last left off, only this time, trying to follow the story, catching every new pokemon on the way and doing some occasional shiny hunting for the shinies I used to have.

I have just finished the game story line and I'm now going to fully complete my pokedex and try to re-obtain all pokemon has shiny (excluding locked ones)",a curious child oc,a curious child oc tldr  year old man relives his childhood dreams last felt with pokemon yellow share your love for the game and what you like the most about it i wanted to share a little story im a  yo man awaiting an asd diagnosis who has played almost every pokemon main game so far ever since platinum i just stopped enjoying them after a few hours games became easier and easier and i just didnt get the same feeling from them in the same i did from yellow blue gold and crystal i plaited them from day of release too i got scarlet on day of release and fell in love with it the sheer idea that i spent  hours playing before getting one badge just because i let the game take me where it wanted trying to explore everything i could before getting to the school once id done the school part of the story i discovered picnic shiny hunting and went around catching pokemon exploring and shiny hunting proceeded with the games story to boost my jumpluff so that it was strong enough to tank moves and put pokemon to sleep i must have caught half a box of shiny pokemon all with only  badge this is truly what this game has to offer this is what the pokemon series needed to become what it used to be i felt like a kid again my switch needed to be repaired because my joycons werent working properly and the repair team messed up said my switch was fine and factory reset it all my time and experience just gone only difference is that this time my daughter had her birthday and we got her a switch with pokemon violet she fell in love with it the way i did when i played pokemon yellow i decided to keep booting new games until we both had all three starters i think found out how to get false swipe and raced my way through to the tera scyther i was determined to get back to where i was i got the scyther obtained false swipe and then i have continued on from where i last left off only this time trying to follow the story catching every new pokemon on the way and doing some occasional shiny hunting for the shinies i used to have i have just finished the game story line and im now going to fully complete my pokedex and try to reobtain all pokemon has shiny excluding locked ones,4

Day 0,200: Misdreavius!

Huh, I did not know it was spelled like that until today. I would have sworn on everything that it was Misdrevious. Whoops.

But hey, it's the feminine ghost Pokemon!

This cute ghost always makes me think of Flurrie from Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door -- I think it's the necklace and Flurrie being ghost like herself. I'm a little tiffed I didn't name my Misdreavius Flurrie now :c

Speaking of which; I'm not the biggest fan of this shiny but I'm also not super against it. Misdreavius turns into a really off shade of gold/green -- While an ugly shade I do think it assists with the spooky coloring. I can't really complain because it *fits* even if I dislike the color.

I actually have this line done in my Shiny Living Dex! My Shiny Misdreavius is named Poe, named after the little ghosts in Legend of Zelda! It's an adorable little thing.

I think Misdreavius is pretty unique in terms of design -- I think it's interesting and playful but I don't have a lot of high attachments to the Pokemon itself. Evne shiny hunting for one twice didn't really give me a good story for it :/

If the Digimon TCG included Appmon within the Digimon Card Game,digimon,"I did these cards awhile back and wanted to share them here as well.

So myself and some members from various digimon forums wondered how the Appmon would play into the digimon card game. So we created our own way they could play. Ones that act as option cards that performs like Tokens and ones that act like digimon cards respectively.

Me being an artist had to make graphics to see how these would look like.

It's not perfect. Text isn't written like the card game and the cards might come off as unbalanced, too strong or too weak... but it was just for fun and pretty sure if the creators of the card game ever do implement Appmon into the card game... it would be ten times better than these.

&#x200B;

What do you think? What would you change or include? I would love positive input on this idea.

here are the images I created:

I need to sell my Digimon collection - hoping to find someone who will appreciate it as much as I have,digimon,"Dear r/digimon community,

I am selling my unique Digimon collection to those who will appreciate it as much as I have. As a fan, I turned to Digimon and nostalgia to help me through a difficult period at the beginning of the pandemic. Now that I am in a better place, I am ready to pass on my collection to fellow fans who will give these items the love and respect they deserve.

The collection includes a Digivice Ver. Complete, which is brand new and has never been opened. Additionally, I have three devices from the Pendulum Z and Pendulum Z II series: Nature Spirits, Deep Savers, and Virus Busters. The Nature Spirits packaging is torn, but the device is still in excellent condition. The Deep Savers device has been opened to check if it's working, but it's still in new condition. The Virus Busters device has also been opened and works perfectly.

Furthermore, I have a few Vital Bracelet DiMs, including a Guilmon, Renamon, and Terriermon collection. These are also available for bidding on eBay.

I am selling my collection because I am going through a difficult time and need the money. If you are interested in any of these items, please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions or make an offer.

Thank you for taking the time to read this post, and I hope these items find a new home with someone who will appreciate them as much as I have.

What are your opinions on Omnimon Merciful Mode?,digimon,"I think he looks very cool, but I really dislike the wings and the new sword.The wings are too thin. I feel that what really brought Omnimon's base design together was his cape. Omnimon has a really slender and thin body, and his cape made his overal sihlouette bulkier, as well as just being plain cool. Without it, Omimon looks kind of scrawny and fragile. Not to say that his armor is not cool loking, but the cape elevated his desing so much. Maybe if Merciful Mode had something more akin to UlforceVeedramon's more cape-like wings.Also, I don't think the single edged curved sword fits. I feel that this type of sword does not work for Omnimon. Since the sword lies parallel to the orientation of his arm, he cannot quickly change the orientation of the sword's cutting edge, making it kind of cluncky.Anyway, what do you guys think about this Ipod looking boy?

Digimon Frontier Fanfiction?,digimon,Can i ask about any good Digimon Frontier Fanfiction?,"Digimon Frontier Fanfiction? Collecting Pokémon cards is often associated with children and nostalgia from the 90s, but in recent years, more and more adults have been getting into the hobby. Some people may question the acceptability of adults collecting these cards, but in reality, there are many reasons why it is a perfectly acceptable hobby for people of all ages.

Firstly, collecting Pokémon cards can provide a sense of joy and excitement for people who have fond memories of the franchise from their childhood. Many adults who collect these cards do so for the nostalgia factor, and there's nothing wrong with reliving happy memories from the past.

Secondly, collecting Pokémon cards can be a fun and rewarding hobby in its own right. The cards themselves are beautifully designed and intricately detailed, and the thrill of completing a set or finding a rare card can be incredibly satisfying. Plus, the trading and social aspects of the hobby can provide opportunities for people to connect and bond over a shared interest.

Thirdly, collecting Pokémon cards can have a financial aspect to it as well. While not all cards will appreciate in value, some rare or highly sought-after cards can be worth a significant amount of money. For some collectors, the potential for financial gain adds another layer of excitement and motivation to their hobby.

Lastly, collecting Pokémon cards is no different from collecting any other type of item, such as stamps, coins, or art. Just because it's associated with a children's franchise doesn't mean it's any less valid as a hobby for adults. In fact, many hobbies that were once considered ""childish"" have become more widely accepted as adult hobbies in recent years, such as comic book collecting or playing video games.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why collecting Pokémon cards as an adult is perfectly acceptable. It can bring joy, provide a fun and rewarding hobby, offer financial potential, and is no different from collecting any other item of interest. As long as it brings happiness and fulfillment to the individual, there is no reason why anyone should feel ashamed or embarrassed for collecting Pokémon cards.",digimon frontier fanfiction,digimon frontier fanfiction collecting pokémon cards is often associated with children and nostalgia from the s but in recent years more and more adults have been getting into the hobby some people may question the acceptability of adults collecting these cards but in reality there are many reasons why it is a perfectly acceptable hobby for people of all ages firstly collecting pokémon cards can provide a sense of joy and excitement for people who have fond memories of the franchise from their childhood many adults who collect these cards do so for the nostalgia factor and theres nothing wrong with reliving happy memories from the past secondly collecting pokémon cards can be a fun and rewarding hobby in its own right the cards themselves are beautifully designed and intricately detailed and the thrill of completing a set or finding a rare card can be incredibly satisfying plus the trading and social aspects of the hobby can provide opportunities for people to connect and bond over a shared interest thirdly collecting pokémon cards can have a financial aspect to it as well while not all cards will appreciate in value some rare or highly soughtafter cards can be worth a significant amount of money for some collectors the potential for financial gain adds another layer of excitement and motivation to their hobby lastly collecting pokémon cards is no different from collecting any other type of item such as stamps coins or art just because its associated with a childrens franchise doesnt mean its any less valid as a hobby for adults in fact many hobbies that were once considered childish have become more widely accepted as adult hobbies in recent years such as comic book collecting or playing video games in conclusion there are many reasons why collecting pokémon cards as an adult is perfectly acceptable it can bring joy provide a fun and rewarding hobby offer financial potential and is no different from collecting any other item of interest as long as it brings happiness and fulfillment to the individual there is no reason why anyone should feel ashamed or embarrassed for collecting pokémon cards,3

However, we are now nine generations in and still haven't gotten the inverse: a Pokemon that can evolve from multiple preevolutions.

Think about how cool of a mechanic this could be in the game: As a type for the stage 1, normal would probably be the best fit, but parallel to Eevee, the preevolutions could be all sorts of types. The preevolutions could all have different abilities and movesets that the stage 1 could inherit. That would leave you with an incredibly customizable Pokemon, where you have no clue what to expect when facing it, until it actually attacks.

I can only see two issues with this and both would be pretty easy to fix:

* When breeding evolved Pokemon, the babies become the unevolved form. In this case with multiple unevolved forms, simply have the baby decided by ability, as those should still be able to be traced back to the basic form the parent-Pokemon originally evolved from.
* It could be kinda weird for the trading card game:

1. In the trading card game, a stage 1 card usually has marked what Pokemon it evolves from, and there is only room for one on the cards. Not a flawless solution, but you could simply not mark it on the card, and instead give each of the basics an ability that basically says ""You can evolve *That Pokemon* onto *This Pokemon.* This counts as an evolution."" (Last part is important because the TCG has some special rules of when you can evolve)
2. The variable attacks. Very similar solution: Use an ability as well! ""This Pokemon can use attacks from its preevolutions. It still needs to fulfill the energy requirements."" (Sorry if the formulation feels off, English isn't my native language so the trading cards I have also don't have their wordings in English)

This works quite well since the TCG's abilities are quite different from the games in a lot of occasions anyway so it wouldn't matter that those wouldn't be abilities in the games.",dw shuttle port theme cover,dw shuttle port theme cover we now have multiple pokemon that can evolve into a few different evolutions with eevee being the most well known example however we are now nine generations in and still havent gotten the inverse a pokemon that can evolve from multiple preevolutions think about how cool of a mechanic this could be in the game as a type for the stage  normal would probably be the best fit but parallel to eevee the preevolutions could be all sorts of types the preevolutions could all have different abilities and movesets that the stage  could inherit that would leave you with an incredibly customizable pokemon where you have no clue what to expect when facing it until it actually attacks i can only see two issues with this and both would be pretty easy to fix  when breeding evolved pokemon the babies become the unevolved form in this case with multiple unevolved forms simply have the baby decided by ability as those should still be able to be traced back to the basic form the parentpokemon originally evolved from  it could be kinda weird for the trading card game  in the trading card game a stage  card usually has marked what pokemon it evolves from and there is only room for one on the cards not a flawless solution but you could simply not mark it on the card and instead give each of the basics an ability that basically says you can evolve that pokemon onto this pokemon this counts as an evolution last part is important because the tcg has some special rules of when you can evolve  the variable attacks very similar solution use an ability as well this pokemon can use attacks from its preevolutions it still needs to fulfill the energy requirements sorry if the formulation feels off english isnt my native language so the trading cards i have also dont have their wordings in english this works quite well since the tcgs abilities are quite different from the games in a lot of occasions anyway so it wouldnt matter that those wouldnt be abilities in the games,5

You could also evolve Pokémon by using them in multiple battles. Imagine an air drop of sorts that drops high level legendaries like Rayquaza, Mewtwo, or Arceus.

It's incredibly fun to tear into this the low quality aspects with a group.

I've done 3/5 Starfall Street, 4/5 Path of Legends. 6/8 Victory Road.  
It's the Psychic Gym that broke me and made me want to write this post. The gym test is banal and insulting, and it's clumsily executed - you can button mash the emotion prompts repeatedly during the time window (why?). 

The plot hasn't been very engaging. With the exception of the Starfall sections, but they're so short and I expect it to disappoint in the end.

Oh! The sandwich making. Wow. Superjank. I can drop every ingredient on the table and the top half of the bread and still get a 2 star sandwich that fully heals my party. What is this system and why

Ugh. I'm of the opinion that if someone says they like this game, then they are lying to me, are blinded by nostalgia, or they have too much brand loyalty.

To begin with, if you are a hater of this theory, just pass by before you minus this post. And it is not necessary to write words that ""You still exist"" and others.

Yes, we exist because and theory has the right to life.

Especially when there is nothing wrong with this theory.

I just happened to notice recently that the sharp end of the Meowscarada mask, lowered down, look like the fangs of a saber-toothed tiger.

Also, this Pokemon has a relatively short tail. They could have made him a long tall, but they made it short.

Which also makes for me a certain resemblance to a saber-toothed tiger.

I've had a project in the works lately. I'm in the midst of assembling a living dex. For anyone unsure of what that means, it means I'm collecting one of every Pokémon, and storing them in National Pokédex order. So one Bulbasaur followed by an Ivysaur, then a Venusaur, so on and so forth. As a rule, I have to make sure that the Pokémon is captured/bred in the region it was introduced in. For example, a Magmar from the Kanto games, Magby from the Johto games, and Magmortar from the Sinnoh games. So far I have everything possible from Gen 1 to 3, and a good chunk if gens 4 and 5. Some mythical like Mew,, Celebi, and Jirachi I obtained via old events in the past, and am using them. For Jirachi I actually got the Collosseum Bonus Disc and plan to use the Wishmaker Jirachi in my living dex. For Deoxys I'm going to replay OR/AS. With that in mind, do you guys have any recommendations on how to carry on with this?

**200: Misdreavus**

Hey look! It's an incomplete Johto Pokémon line! 

Actually, just how much Misdreavus was screwed over doesn't even stop there. Despite being the ONLY ghost type added in Johto, at a time where the Gastly line was the only other Ghost at all, Misdreavus wasn't even used by the supposed Ghost specialist in the region. It's such a baffling exclusion - you had two options and you went with Gastly evolutions for all of them, Morty. Just... what? Why?!

...but my complaints end there, really. Misdreavus could've been treated better, but it was a good design with an expressive personality. To compliment Gengar's creativity, the second ghost type was a more traditional banshee, just made adorable, and with a feminine witchy vibe with beautiful hair. I adore feminine and elegant Pokémon a lot, and Misdreavus works wonders as a cohesive, ghostly design that is both cute and pretty, setting up for it's evolution into the witchy Mismagius later on.

It also got an incredible Paradox form in Gen 9, so it's certainly a Pokémon who got treated much better over time. But I can't quite gush about that one yet, even if it's super pretty and badass and *who's a good little overpower-Pokemon-immediately-banned-to-ubers, yes, you are\~* D'awww, the Pokémon world couldn't handle it\~

But as for Misdreavus in a vacuum? Beautiful Pokémon with immaculate vibes, and I'm happy it got treated better over time. The only reason it's in **B+ Tier** and not any of the As is because of the steep competition and a few complaints about Mismagius I'll get to later - you might claim that's unfair to Misdreavus, but cute pre-evolutions aren't my favorite archetype, so they generally don't get to the A Tiers on their own.

Not sure if this is discussed before but I think we might have another case where gamefreak had a loose idea and then decided to go about it a different way, I.e nidroian being two Pokémon where future games given one Pokémon two different gender forms.",a question regarding lifespan in next order,a question regarding lifespan in next order just a thought since i have heard people say that in sword and shield that game hints that the regional birds might not actually be true regional variants like the other pokémon i understand gameplay wise yes they are regional variants but lord wise if they arent actually related to the kanto birds that would make them convergents of them not sure if this is discussed before but i think we might have another case where gamefreak had a loose idea and then decided to go about it a different way ie nidroian being two pokémon where future games given one pokémon two different gender forms,7

I know someone made a post about Rewriting Davis Motomiya, but he wasn't specific. Davis Motomiya is really underrated in my opinion, but, honestly, I prefer him over TK and Kari, who are terrible characters in my opinion(Sorry 1999 fans). I feel like he there was a lot of untapped potential in him and if he had more character growth and development, then he, I hope I don't jinx it, would be one of the best Goggle-Heads.

If I were to rewrite Daisuke, then I would still keep his hot-headed personality and make him a bit obnoxious but tone it down. He would still see Tai as a idol to him and wouldn't have that annoying crush he had on Kari. In my personal rewrite of 02, Jun would be cut out and he would be a single child, but his dad died when he was just 5 months old, as a baby. I'd have his character arc be him learning to become his own leader instead being a ripoff of Tai.

By the end of my rewrite, he'd still be a bit hot-headed, but is no more obnoxious and, instead, more serious and cocky and, kind of, humble like his sub counterpart. Now, I know you guys are going to say ""make him similar to his sub counterpart"" and that's fine.

I've been collecting what they leave behind since we can't sell it, and giving the TCG codes and any cards needed to a friend who plays competitively. Well anyways, I now have thousands of cards taking up space, and the card stacks are ever-growing bc kids will be kids. I was handing them out at the park to the kids in the neighborhood, but there's been lots of rain this year making it difficult to encounter them and the cards themselves aren't waterproof obviously. I'll be at work when the sun finally comes out and I'll miss them. :(

I was thinking of putting up a display on the table under the pagoda where the kids can take from it freely. The families come in herds, with many mothers and MANY kids at a time so they would be less likely to allow just one child to take it all and would be forced to share it to avoid chaos. What would you use to put, say, about 50 cards in? To waterproof but also keep them rigid. That I can buy in bulk (at hopefully a relatively cheap price)? I have bad experiences with just ziplocks baggies (bent cards, ripped bags), and would like to put them in a bit more formal looking boxes. There must be something, but I can't think of a name of the ""item"" the box to put them in that I can buy in some sort of bulk to hand them out. It's probably something super obvious but the words just escape me and I've been trying to think of it for weeks now. But most the stuff I come across is just not ""card sized"" or holds too many nor comes in bulk.

I've already partitioned the cards into various mixes, they each have commons, medium, rares, vmaxes, holographics and more. So each pack has somewhat equal the goodies they can enjoy.",ive documented on youtube all the digimon i have raised on these  bracelet be bememory dim youtube playlist in caption,ive documented on youtube all the digimon i have raised on these  bracelet be bememory dim youtube playlist in caption hewwo i work at a retail store where kids rip open the shiny alluring pokemon card packs just about everyday ive been collecting what they leave behind since we cant sell it and giving the tcg codes and any cards needed to a friend who plays competitively well anyways i now have thousands of cards taking up space and the card stacks are evergrowing bc kids will be kids i was handing them out at the park to the kids in the neighborhood but theres been lots of rain this year making it difficult to encounter them and the cards themselves arent waterproof obviously ill be at work when the sun finally comes out and ill miss them  i was thinking of putting up a display on the table under the pagoda where the kids can take from it freely the families come in herds with many mothers and many kids at a time so they would be less likely to allow just one child to take it all and would be forced to share it to avoid chaos what would you use to put say about  cards in to waterproof but also keep them rigid that i can buy in bulk at hopefully a relatively cheap price i have bad experiences with just ziplocks baggies bent cards ripped bags and would like to put them in a bit more formal looking boxes there must be something but i cant think of a name of the item the box to put them in that i can buy in some sort of bulk to hand them out its probably something super obvious but the words just escape me and ive been trying to think of it for weeks now but most the stuff i come across is just not card sized or holds too many nor comes in bulk ive already partitioned the cards into various mixes they each have commons medium rares vmaxes holographics and more so each pack has somewhat equal the goodies they can enjoy,20

"couple more Next Order questions: key digi, comboing big attacks, lowering discipline",digimon,"Hey again!

1. I see ""Key Digi"" in the list of requirements for Digivolving but don't quite understand what it means, I've seen in forums and stuff that it could mean ""one of your current Digimon has to be the Key Digi for this to be fulfilled"" or ""the Digimon you want to Digivolve has to *be* the Key Digi."" Can anyone clarify what exactly it means lol

2. I heard you could launch both partner Digimon's specials at the same time, is that true? Dunno if I'm doing something wrong but when I order one special, it seems like I can't do anything else til they're done using it.

3. How do you decrease discipline? I feel like literally everything I do increases it. I'm actually somewhat sure that *scolding* increases it a bit too. 

Thanks for all the help! I feel like soon I'm gonna have to learn about elemental stuff too. Heading to Logic Volcano soon.

A bit of a different post today -- A very long super post catching me up because I am *so behind*! A lot of these are gonna be quickfire just so I can get them out so uwu let's get this show on the road!

0,191: Sunkern!

&#x200B;

[Art by  Doopliss on Zerochan!](https://preview.redd.it/u4earngrutma1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=16aa1740d38a2ddb5c98dc54ae37d80ff537d429)

So Hoppip was supposed to represent a seed but I expressed how it kind of made no sense that it was pink and cat like -- I still think it makes little to no sense. Especially when Sunkern is just a few lines down! What they did wrong with Hoppip they did right with Sunkern!

I think Sunkern is such an adorable concept -- It's a little sunflower seed!! LIke -- LOOK AT IT!!

It looks like it's having a good time and I'm here for it. It's such a cool concept that I'm glad that they did right --

I actually have a shiny one of these -- I can't remember if I evolved it or not but it's named ""Pandora"" and I was hunting it on a mirage island on ORAS! She may be a Sunflora now -- I can't really remember >v<;;

Overall I'd put Sunkern in the **B** rank. I think it's a super fun concept that they pulled off really well. I wish they'd take these simple ideas and make them into Pokemon like back then -- I feel like sometimes they go *too* complex with designs lately that they lose out on the charm.

Like where is my DUST BUNNY POKEMON??? I'M WAITING GAME FREAK

0,192: Sunflora!

&#x200B;

[Art by Pokedump on tumblr!](https://preview.redd.it/8ut7r2nbvtma1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=995956e4ec28479e8f013091abd6365c49d1c628)

While I really like Sunkern, I actually don't like Sunflora nearly as much. Which is a shame because Sunflowers are my favorite flowers! I love Sunflowers and feel like they could have done this Pokemon really well -- but they just... didn't?

And it's not even the simplicity of it. You can make designs simple and still work -- Sunflora just... lacks Sunkern's cheer, I think? There's just something off about it.

Honestly I wish they looked more like the adorable Sunflowers in Mario Sunshine. I adored those things when I'd play that game.

But sadly, despite the really good start and my bias for sunflowers, Sunflora still just.. lacks :c Which sucks.

I did like the minigame in S/V when there were like 10 running around you though. That was fun.

**C-**

0,193: Yanma!

&#x200B;

[Art by Decy on twitter!](https://preview.redd.it/g1ei1yxlvtma1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f35eff817cf58aa3a50839999e032c527ed29445)

For a Dragonfly Pokemon, Yanma has a really super interesting design. I thing it's aesthetically nice to look at it and Pokemon stays pretty loyal to the behavior of an actual dragonfly -- Seeing these Pokemon move in the 3D models is really fun because of how erratic they fly! 

While I think these little *buggers* are adorable, they do lack a certain... something to them.

I haven't ever heard of them being used for competitive or even during normal playthroughs; Even with an added evolution later on it doesn't seem to help this line at all which just sort of leaves them abandoned in the 'useless bug' category :c which sucks because they're so cute and interesting! I love dragonflies!

But yeah -- Overall I'll have to put Yanma in **C**.

0,194: Wooper!

&#x200B;

[ cona\_25 on twitter!](https://preview.redd.it/nfk4byhhwtma1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f2178d0b88b9422475a9fcf0f4b8a51e3fd2f9b7)

Lookie at the little Wopper -- whoops I meant Whooper -- Defiinitely don't need to mistake those >v<

But yeah, it's the little axolotl bean! I ***love*** Wooper. Look at its dopey little smile! If you weren't aware already I enjoy Pokemon that loo like they're happy to be alive. Wooper's just a happy little dude and I adore this huggable bean!

Wooper's also pretty memorable to me -- For a long time Wooper was the longest Masuda hunt I ever did. I was well over the 1k's and was struggling hardcore with maintaining the drive to keep going. Coincidentally I had seen a video of an albino exolotl and showed my best friend the video, expressing that it looked like a shiny Wooper

My best friend, knowing I was driving myself nuts with the hunt, made an off hand comment about how I didn't have one and I *immediately* got one as soon as she sent the message. In honor of the albino Axolotl in the video, my shiny Wooper's named Ripley! UwU

But yeah, Wooper's just a cute and adorable bean with an interesting and unique design that leads into one of the (in my opinion) one of the best gen 2 Pokemon to use in game.

Wooper's definitely a **A** Pokemon. 

**Paldean Wooper:** I actually used a Paldean Wooper in my playthrough of S/V and I'll be honest -- I'm not the biggest fan. I prefer the OG Wooper :c It's just... not as much of a huggable bean. **C-**

0,195: Quagsire!

&#x200B;

[Art by Berlin Lopez on tumblr!](https://preview.redd.it/4omn9pf4ytma1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a92bb61d9dd7bd17cdb291ea29ca4efc576d6973)

So, I'll start off the bat that I adore Pokemon that can completely evade their weaknesses just because of their unique typing or abilities. I know that Quagsire is 4x weak to grass, but I'm always so interested in the fact that it's ground typing can completely evade the electric weakness it would have if it was just water! I remember Bertha's Quagsire threw me off *so much* in Diamond and Pearl!

Visually also I just love this Pokemon. It falls into the ""it's just happy to be alive"" and so I can't hate it. I've never used a Quagsire in a game but I wish I could! It's such a fun little dude!

I also have a shiny one of these -- with a less interesting story than Ripley but it's always fun to have a completed line in the Shiny Living Dex!

The only complaints I really have about Quagsire is the 4x weakness to grass -- while also just being *a little* bland? Like, I have no complaints but I also wouldn't complain if there was a little more visually to the Pokemon.

I still love Quagsire though and I'm more than okay with putting it in **A+**

**Paldean Quagsire:** I used one in my playthrough and I'm not gonna lie. I wasn't a fan. I felt like the Pokemon wasn't tanky enough to live long enough and there was just better options in this region that made it less likely to use. Although it *is* the only reason why I beat Eri when I had to poison stall her Annihliape. Regardless this Pokemon's going in the **D** rank. I just... I don't vibe as well with the Paldean forms of this mon.

Day 0,196: ESPEON!!

&#x200B;

[Art by OhSweetsSweetie on tumblr!](https://preview.redd.it/ooyqtwemztma1.png?width=420&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f479ddeb9564e2cd8f79a7d084d66d37ad9e91cd)

&#x200B;

I LOVE ESPEON!! SO MUCH!!!

It's an adorable little psychic cat -- did anybody expect anything different? Espeon's as adorable as it is powerful! 

But the biggest reason for love comes from Pokemon Colosseum when the two Pokemon you start off with is Umbreon and Espeon! I remember becoming enamored with this badass psychic cat the moment I saw her in this game and she became a star player in my team. 

While Espeon isn't my favorite out of the eeveelutions it's definitely in the top 3. I've considered getting matching tattoo's with my best friend of an Espeon/Umbreon duo because even though it isn't my *favorite*, I still like it enough that I wouldn't complain about matching on with my bestie!

The only thing that I have to complain about when it comes to Espeon is that as more Psychic types were introduces and more options were brought up; The less needed it was. Espeon just kind of became a token eeveelution which is a little upsetting but I guess on par for how Eeveelutions work overall. Even if they're important and well loved they don't really live up to the love in terms of being useful in battle.

I still think Espeon is amazing though and I love that it got put in Unite too <3

**A+**

Day 0,197: Umbreon!!

&#x200B;

[Art by OhSweetsSweetie on tumblr!](https://preview.redd.it/90vjhhcl0uma1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2fa7046f5935acbf713019ae38f0ebf844bd3ab7)

While I adore Umbreon, I don't like them as much as I love Espeon. I can get behind the really cool and regal design but it's far more dog like which isn't as appealing to my cat obsessed heart.

For some reason looking for fanart of Umbreon unlocked the memory more than Espeon but I remember being young and on the internet and finding videos online of dramatic love storeis between Espeon and Umbreon -- Using Deviantart inspired fanart to tell the stories of two Eevees in love that are torn apart by.. something or other and evolving to save each other or something lol

They were so cringey but I remember watching each and every one of them I could get my hands on (as well as the cringey Sonic ones but shhh this is a Poke list)

But yeah! Regardless of cringey childhood bias I like Umbreon for what it is but not as much as Espeon. It doens't help that I don't think it's nearly as powerful as Espeon so it gets -- no pun intended -- overshadowed. 

I will admit that it has an awesome shiny though!

**B**

Day 0,198: Murkrow!

&#x200B;

[Art by  1-084 on Deviantart!](https://preview.redd.it/v81kkoce1uma1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=39c9e84e6d289d0146f15d699489f861c692d9b3)

Honestly, like HootHoot I feel like it wasn't hard to get this design right. 

But they really did get this design right. I love Murkrow's cute little witches hat added to the crow design! It's so creative and really adds to the design.

It's also hilarious that Murkrow has the same catch rate as Palkia... *for some reason*.

Like I'm so glad that this dumb bird is harder to catch than a literal time god! It's amazingly funny but makes me groan anytime I need to catch a Murkrow for my living dex (which means I normally have to catch two ugh)

But no, I do like Murkrow a lot. I've never used this line and haven't really had a huge drive *to* but the design is appealing enough to rank it at least above average.

Too bad it has a dumb bright pink shiny >:C

**C**

**0,199: Slowking!**

&#x200B;

[Art by AutobotTesla on Deviantart!](https://preview.redd.it/bo6mwle62uma1.png?width=225&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6330cbd900d11477b59017865c468f96004bf262)

Slowking makes me so embarrassed aaaaa -- When I was playing S/V I so desperately wanted to use one on my team but I was really stupid and thought that the line went Slowpoke -> Slowbrow -> Slowking

I completely forgot that it was it's own evolution and you needed to evolve it a special way before it evolved int Slowbro jdakl;fjdsd

I was so upset because I actually really like Slowking. A lot of it may be nostalgia with the Pokemon's major inclusion in the second Pokemon movie; I remember when I saw this Pokemon on the tv I put it up on the same level as *legendaries* because it just seemed super important. 

I'm also a sucker for scarves and it looks like Slowking has one -- so visually I like it way more than Slowbro.

I'd put Slowking in the **B** rank!

**Galarian Slowking:** Nobody look the edge lord is here! No but fr this thing is so goofy looking I can't ever take it seriously. Slowking always gave a sage vibe but Galarian Slowking just kind of looks like a joke lmao. **D**.

Vpet color question for anyone that has it,digimon,I dont understand Japanese but I am able to bumble through most the settings. My issue is sometimes Japanese text appearing then once I back out It resets the time. Idk what im doing but now it reset my agumon back to an egg xD idk does anyone else have this issue? Other then that I love it,Vpet color question for anyone that has it My favorite Pokémon is Croagunk but I can’t find any plushies. So I thought that maybe I should get a plushie of a Pokémon that’s know for being a good friend.

End Game/Future Device Possibilities,digimon,"Hey im just here to rant some idea or things i would love to see in the future and was curious what other people would love to see also or think about all this.

\-My main wish would be to see them remake all devices from each gen and update them adding Wif/phone link while also creating a better app sorta like Pokemon go that links to all devices.

\-The app would then have purchasable Digimon lines, storage, online battle arenas for pvp everything should be crossdevice transferable and replace dim cards and  create like more storage or add micro SD card system to the devices so people can just use it to transfer progress offline this way.

\-There would be events, boss raids, certain free eggs/digimon earned via quests like walking distance or battle wins, earning cosmetics for avatars via rank or raids also cosmetic  sales to earn the company money and keep the game alive.

\-Rework of the battle and stat system for the digimon for example weekly/daily distance travel  plus ur average heart rate should impact the digimons HP stat by adding like say 5-10% to its max potential in that area so not all digimon are the equal, while battles wins losses affect its Power.   
\-Player levels should be added with other systems such as total eggs raised, battles, quest finished, travel distance, Exercises completed which impact your digimons ability to grow and power.

\-A crest system sorta like club/house depending on what crest you choose at the start it should add % to a certain stat and monthly rewards for top  players of each crest house.

examples Courage- 5% power, Love % Faster egg growth etc 

\-They could also add like a healing system where walking a certain distance allows you to battle again at raids to earn exp/ stats to slow down progress a tad  and make it slightly grindy so its not super easy

\-As for how the company would make money they could Sell digimon lines, Cosmetics, special event tickets to earn eggs and they could implement battle passes to earn eggs cosmetics (none of this should be pay to win just cosmetic and unique for people that want to support and look different.

i know this all sounds  like Pokemon go but yeah haha would love digimon to  make something of that caliber where we can all interact, battle and more modern style then just evolve walk etc.   
Would love to hear other peoples ideas of what they would like to see and think of all this maybe you still love the old style and don't want it to change.","End Game/Future Device Possibilities This topic popped up as my 7 year old son was telling me the names of his Pokémon in Violet.

"are the Digimon X devices considered ""limited"" ?",digimon,"i've just been wondering since i've been seeing them with a 'roll back' price cut on Walmart and the fact most of the ones on amazon say there's "" only 5 remaining""

i know about the factory errors that caused them to have the wrong digimon on their respective device But my question is :

  
have they been phasing out the XC and the XD completely due to those errors?

 keeping the release the way it was ( not releasing anymore copies of the XC or XD - leaving sort of a stagnant market)

or releasing more XC and XD with the proper lineups?

Not sure if I can post this here. I really like gabumon and its evolutions. Here’s a model kit for metalgarurumon.,digimon,,"Not sure if I can post this here. I really like gabumon and its evolutions. Here’s a model kit for metalgarurumon. I don't understand why Ice has no resistances. It's sad that the only Ice type viable pokemon are Glass canon. Why? Pokemons like Mamoswine are big and they should be resistant, they should be tanky. Ice is hard, Ice is not an easy material to deal with. 

&#x200B;

You have to be though to resist in cold temperature, so why every Ice type pokemon is a chips that gets obliterated easily? 

&#x200B;

**Okay, you can't give em Grass and Bug resistance because Grass and Bug are already in a bad state.** 

&#x200B;

But Ground is a very strong type, being super effective against Fire, Rock, Steel, Poison and Electric, it's wouldn't hurt to have Ice resisting it since it's already a super effective typing vs Ground. 

&#x200B;

Dragon because it's already super effective vs Dragon and Dragon doesn't have many weaknesses, it's one of the strongest typing, so it's not like a resistance to it would hurt. 

&#x200B;

 Flying, because Flying is only resisted by Steel and Rock and is super effective against Fighting, Bug and Grass. And because I don't see Birds having enough power to crush ice. Most Birds can't stand the cold... 

&#x200B;

And for Offense, Ice should do neutral damage vs Water and the super effective damage should depend on the weather. 

&#x200B;

For example, an Ice type under a snowy weather would deal supereffective damage against Water because the cold from the weather would help him to freeze the water. 

&#x200B;

And on the opposite side, Water pokemons under rain should be able to do super effective damage against Ice pokemons since Ice melts faster when you have many drops of room temperature weather. 

&#x200B;

That would make an interesting use in the Weather. Weather moves would be more useful and interesting if it's could change the damage chart like this. I know Freeze Dry and Scald exists but it's would be an addition to these 2 moves. 

&#x200B;

Weather could also boost some passives like Thick fat. Thick fat should be 50% more effective under Snow and on the opposite side, under Harsh sunlight, Thick fat isn't effective. That's would make the game more strategic and Weather would play a major role. An effective Typing wouldn't be the only thing needed to beat your opponent which would add more challenge. 

&#x200B;

* **Rework of the Frozen status**

&#x200B;

Frozen shouldn't be a paralysis like Thunder Wave or Stun spore. It's should be more like a slow (big speed reduction + attack and attack spe reduction and def/def spe reduction). The pokemon would still be able to act but he would be greatly disabled which is the normal reaction of the body when you're in hypothermia. You're not completely paralyzed but you're clearly not in a great shape. 

&#x200B;

I think it's important to make Freezing different from Paralysis. Because I don't see what the difference is. I feel like Paralysis is easier to place but the pokemon can still move sometimes which is weird and Frozen is very hard to pull on but then it's completely prevent the enemy pokemon from moving/attacking. Making them different from each other would be nice. 

&#x200B;

**And Ice moves should be super effective vs any frozen target. No matter what typing they have, even if it's a Fire/Steel pokemon for example. If it's frozen, the Ice moves should do super effective damage.** 

&#x200B;

This way, freezing becomes a very interesting status. If you manage to freeze your opponent, he'll have to cure his freezing, otherwise you'll be able to place super effective hits no matter his typing. 

&#x200B;

Or if you think it's would be too OP, in that case we could only add a damage boost against Frozen target for Ice attacks, this way it's wouldn't be too ""OP"" but would still reward you for freezing your opponent. 

&#x200B;

What do you think about these changes? Ice would become a nice powerful typing with that set of moves.",not sure if i can post this here i really like gabumon and its evolutions heres a model kit for metalgarurumon,not sure if i can post this here i really like gabumon and its evolutions heres a model kit for metalgarurumon i dont understand why ice has no resistances its sad that the only ice type viable pokemon are glass canon why pokemons like mamoswine are big and they should be resistant they should be tanky ice is hard ice is not an easy material to deal with xb you have to be though to resist in cold temperature so why every ice type pokemon is a chips that gets obliterated easily xb okay you cant give em grass and bug resistance because grass and bug are already in a bad state xb but ground is a very strong type being super effective against fire rock steel poison and electric its wouldnt hurt to have ice resisting it since its already a super effective typing vs ground xb dragon because its already super effective vs dragon and dragon doesnt have many weaknesses its one of the strongest typing so its not like a resistance to it would hurt xb flying because flying is only resisted by steel and rock and is super effective against fighting bug and grass and because i dont see birds having enough power to crush ice most birds cant stand the cold xb and for offense ice should do neutral damage vs water and the super effective damage should depend on the weather xb for example an ice type under a snowy weather would deal supereffective damage against water because the cold from the weather would help him to freeze the water xb and on the opposite side water pokemons under rain should be able to do super effective damage against ice pokemons since ice melts faster when you have many drops of room temperature weather xb that would make an interesting use in the weather weather moves would be more useful and interesting if its could change the damage chart like this i know freeze dry and scald exists but its would be an addition to these  moves xb weather could also boost some passives like thick fat thick fat should be  more effective under snow and on the opposite side under harsh sunlight thick fat isnt effective thats would make the game more strategic and weather would play a major role an effective typing wouldnt be the only thing needed to beat your opponent which would add more challenge xb  rework of the frozen status xb frozen shouldnt be a paralysis like thunder wave or stun spore its should be more like a slow big speed reduction  attack and attack spe reduction and defdef spe reduction the pokemon would still be able to act but he would be greatly disabled which is the normal reaction of the body when youre in hypothermia youre not completely paralyzed but youre clearly not in a great shape xb i think its important to make freezing different from paralysis because i dont see what the difference is i feel like paralysis is easier to place but the pokemon can still move sometimes which is weird and frozen is very hard to pull on but then its completely prevent the enemy pokemon from movingattacking making them different from each other would be nice xb and ice moves should be super effective vs any frozen target no matter what typing they have even if its a firesteel pokemon for example if its frozen the ice moves should do super effective damage xb this way freezing becomes a very interesting status if you manage to freeze your opponent hell have to cure his freezing otherwise youll be able to place super effective hits no matter his typing xb or if you think its would be too op in that case we could only add a damage boost against frozen target for ice attacks this way its wouldnt be too op but would still reward you for freezing your opponent xb what do you think about these changes ice would become a nice powerful typing with that set of moves,21

A while ago, I had a new perspective on what Digimon are. They are a manifested representation of their partner's heart. And I love this so much. I'm into deep stuff. 😁

Yesterday something came to my mind and it hit me: What would our world look like if we had Digimon partners? Then I went deep into it.

How would that be even possible? In that story a videogame would be created at some point, at first it just being a game. With time Digimon would get conscious about themselves being alive and after a while leaving the videogame. They would find a way to communicate with us. First maybe through computers, showing up as eggs on the desktop. Us being curious we interact with them, like we know it as Tamagotchi. At first thinking it would be just a game or something, they might start speaking to us at some point, and slowly realizing that they truly live, for many people hard to believe at first. But with time we would bond with them in a very special way.

For some, when they would touch their screen, longing to feel their Digimon close to them, they would either get sucked into a kind of digital world, meeting their partner, and together coming back into our world, living together there. Or their Digimon partner would leave the digital world at some point, when their bond is strong, meeting their human partner in our world.

This would happen around the world, for those who are ready. Remember, they are a representation of their human partner's heart. Not everyone is ready to face that. We learned to suppress a lot of pain, which would come up as well, when they meet (maybe not as first and maybe only subconsciously, but it needs the will to face it, to accept it, integrating that pain).

From there many stories could be told and those special bonds would be truly magical. I am so fascinated with that.

At the same time, conflict would arise. People without Digimon might resent those with Digimon. The military would want to use Digimon as weapons and would successfully do so by creating devices to control them. They would force them to digivolve into dark digivolutions.

Some Digimon in the digital world who do not agree with humans having partners, would manipulate governments and the military for their own agenda.

I could go in more detail, but I will leave it here for now.

What do you think about this idea? Is it worth being realized in some kind of form?","What if we had Digimon partners in our world?

[Digimon next order] question regarding fainting,digimon,"(1) what is the penalty if both digimon faint in battle?

Is there a penalty?","[Digimon next order] question regarding fainting So when we all first started playing Pokémon, we had no idea what we were doing, and ended up awkwardly getting through the game with an extremely non-optimized party. When my sister gets to badge 8 in her first playthrough, we all end up losing to Giovanni hundreds of times doing trial and error, and eventually discover a weird trick. Against his Nidoking, Exeggcute will either be immune from all damage, or it will simply use non-damaging moves forever (I forget which). The level difference was such that to win, we had to resort to struggle, but it always worked in the end. Nowhere on the internet in all the years since have I found anyone else who found this, or an explanation for it. The only other weird clue/coincidence I discovered was that in my copy of the Official Pokémon Handbook, the side note about how struggle works happened to be on the same page as Exeggcute, which always made me wonder if someone who wrote that book knew something.",digimon next order question regarding fainting,digimon next order question regarding fainting so when we all first started playing pokémon we had no idea what we were doing and ended up awkwardly getting through the game with an extremely nonoptimized party when my sister gets to badge  in her first playthrough we all end up losing to giovanni hundreds of times doing trial and error and eventually discover a weird trick against his nidoking exeggcute will either be immune from all damage or it will simply use nondamaging moves forever i forget which the level difference was such that to win we had to resort to struggle but it always worked in the end nowhere on the internet in all the years since have i found anyone else who found this or an explanation for it the only other weird cluecoincidence i discovered was that in my copy of the official pokémon handbook the side note about how struggle works happened to be on the same page as exeggcute which always made me wonder if someone who wrote that book knew something,6

Ryudamon with its ryu series was made to explore the potential of digimon fighting strength with the data of dragons and generals of japanese culture, hence he becomes a weapon for alphamon where all of his fighting strength is focused exclusively to its attacks.

Could Veemon Digievolve into Slashangemon?,digimon,"Okay, I know this is a weird question, but I got the idea from a 02 Reboot video I've been watching.

Modern Pokemon games are great, but nothing beats the excitement of playing Pokemon with your friends at school in the era that those games first came out. I grew up in the Gen 1-3 era, but didn't start playing until Gen 2 (Gold). I bought Red afterwards since it was still being sold in stores at the time, but nobody was really playing Gen 1 anymore at that time so I didn't get to enjoy it to the fullest extent (though was able to trade some Gen 1 Pokemon to Gold). Gens 2 and 3 however are a different story. They were the newest and most popular games at the time and EVERYONE was playing them. You could trade and battle with friends, spread playground rumors and utilize all of the options available in the games that aren't really available in emulators today, such as Mystery Gift, mixing records in RSE, the Union Rooms in FRLG, E-reader cards to get specific key items, Action Replays/GameSharks and ToysRus giveaways. 

I feel I was lucky to fully experience those games at that time and glad I grew up with those games. Emulators and ROMs are great, but it's hard to fully emulate the experience you had playing those games when they first came out. Likewise some people may have preferred to grow up with later gens to fully experience playing with friends at that time, because when I was in middle school and highschool and the DS games were coming out, not as many people my age were playing anymore so it was a much more solo experience for me, whereas it wouldn't have been if they came out when I was in elementary school. Which era would you have preferred to grow up in?

The ultimate Digimon game idea!,digimon,"Hello community, I've been an avid digimon fan and have loved the brand, show, and games for a long time. I literally grew up on it. I have a game concept that I would love to see happen and wonder why it never has been done. It would put pokemon and many other competing brands to shame and make the digimon brand a lot of money. I'm putting this out there now just because I wish it would eventually happen.

&#x200B;

The game concept is a mobile app where your phone is a digivice. The general function is that of the tradition v1 digivices where you raise, train, and battle your monster with your friends... just maybe not as time consuming on the maintenance side and more focus on the training because of today's attention span. You could even do it with a digivice type device in replacement of a mobile phone app to increase sales.... just updated for modern times. The funnest part of the digivice was schooling your friends on the playground with the monster you raised.

&#x200B;

The next aspect of the game is the heftier side of the development.  Create a MMO with a campaign to play along side the monster(s) you raise on your device in the digital world. The stats and monster would literally upload/download based on how you train them on the mobile app/digivice. You could even recreate the world and story while referencing the old TV shows and games. Have a party feature for kid's and fans to party up and have fun together after school/work. A battle and tournament aspect would be a necessity for people who want to focus on monster raising and training on a world class scale. Add armour and special digivolution quests in the game and finish with a saving the world with your monster (in the story) or create a global game event... or you could create a world that keeps developing and have different seasons. (season 1, 2 3, etc.)

They wouldn't have to even make this game as a one-off because they could add new aspects and stories to the game the further the game develops. It would be much better than the cyber slueth/digimon world games they have been developing because they could tell their story and add new features based on the season of the game they are on. Introduce new exclusive items and add expansions as well.

So how you bandai make money other than the app/digivice? Create microtransactions for different accessories for monsters/character avatars in the game... could even have stat boosts to buy if you wanted but would not recommend a pay to win option.... Also keep developing the many digimon stories into the game.  It would be much better than the cyber slueth/digimon world games they have been developing because they could tell their story and add new features based on the season of the game they are on. Introduce new exclusive items and add expansions based on the stories as well.

Anyway, would love to hear the fandom's thoughts and maybe someday see  game like this happen. I've been thinking about it for years but will never have the ability to develop it myself so I figured I'd give my idea to the world and see if anything comes of it.

&#x200B;

If you would want to see a game like this please help get this concept out so the developers and other digimon brand managers in this community can see it. I would love to live in a world where I actually train and raise a digimon that feels like an actual partner!",The ultimate Digimon game idea! ,the ultimate digimon game idea,the ultimate digimon game idea,5

Next order for switch,digimon,Just got world next order for the switch and it’s my first digimon “world” game and I’m loving it so far but does wisdom only affect your MP? Or is there like a physical/special split as in the Pokémon games? Just wondering how to properly train my digital beauties!,"Next order for switch Awesome. Decided to take the plunge down the pokemon rabbit hole. There is about 9 games total on Switch. I have Lets go pokemon, shield, brilliant diamond, scarlet and violet so far but intend to collect and catch them all. 

But what is unclear to me as noob to those games is how do I use pokemon home and when? Do I use it as stickerbook that needs to have one of each? Or is it only temp transfer? Kinda hard to understand If I need the subscription there. 

The other thing is going trough all the Switch games I noticed that there is also line of Pokemon on previous handhelds. I remember as a kid dreaming of getting those games. But it seems it is closing down together with pokemon bank. Should I rush to get it or does it not matter as I can sideload Pokemon Bank on that console later and transfer anyway?

Oh and there is dlc also I suppose. Do I need to get dlc for both versions of game (say scarlet and violet) or is one good enough to catch all the new pokemons in dlc?

**199: Slowking**

I have to admit, out of all of Johto's weird alternate evolutions, the one that makes the most sense is Slowking. In all honesty, I could've seen Slowking as an evolution to Slowbro - it's name and design are both considerable more intimidating, but even as a split path, this one actually seems to make sense. 

Granted, I've never been... especially fond of the Slowpoke line. If you were to check my previous entries, I criticized it's personality as being one dimensional and overly specific for a species of Pokémon, and admitted that a lot of it's humor was lost on me. However... I think Slowking becomes an exception, in that while it retains a ditzy, oafish look, it boasts actual intelligence in a ditzy way that befits the Psychic typing. Giving Slowpoke, a one dimensional line dependent on another Pokémon for it's only gimmick, a more regal and pompous design element worked surprisingly naturally, and made Slowking more respectable. 

I totally overlooked this design admittedly until Scarlet & Violet, which did it SO much justice. I love it's relationship with Oranguru and how it was implemented mechanically in addition to just Pokedex entries. The ideas of a genuinely intelligent, mystic scholar debating against a doofus pretending to be smart is just a legendary interaction - and Slowking's new signature move, ""Chilly Reception"", is flat out hilarious. Imagine being so unwitty that you tell a joke that causes a snowstorm... and leaving the battle in shame and embarrassment is just a phenomenal cherry on top.

The Slowpoke line was almost entirely confined to the C Tier, but after Generation 9... I have to concede that I immensely underrated Slowking. Take your crown, buddy, you've made it to the **B Tier** alongside all the Pokemon I like with no reservations.

**199\*: Galarian Slowking**

Siiiiiigh. Mark it down in your history books, people, today, I confess, that a Galarian variant for once is not actually an improvement. I admit - I'm biased in favor of the modern design philosophy, Galar and Paldea are my favorite mainline regions. But even I have to admit that this design is awful, ugly, and actually rather insulting. 

What's most insulting is that it's so close to being good! Like, you could've just made the whole thing purple and doubled down on the evil sorcerer vibe. This could've been the Ganondorf of Pokémon with an intimidating, yet regal stature. Instead, we got... this diseased looking, ugly mess of colors.

I hate it. I hate it more because I actually started to like the original. But either way, I won't beat a dead horse - I've yet to meet anyone who likes this form. And if you do, PLEASE tell me why in the comments. For now... **F Tier**.

Got Dukemon on my X1... but Barbamon on the X2 instead of Lillithmon.,digimon,"So it's weird. In the Humulos site it says you need to clear Area 39, have no or at least 1 CM and be level 10 as MetalPiranimon.  I had all that but I still got a Barbamon (which has the same requirements as Lillithmon except that you need to have Area 39 NOT cleared), so that means once you clear Area 39 Barbamon's requirements become moot?

With Humulos in the discord we determined that as MetalPiranimon you would also need to clear the last area to get Lillithmon.

Re:Digitize Decode Training spots,digimon,"I was wondering if in this game its better fighting wild digis to level stats, like in Next Order, and if so, where are the best zones by stat level. Couldnt find any guided about that","Re:Digitize Decode Training spots Title says it all. Tell me your thoughts in the comments.

Disclaimer: Some of my picks are slightly influenced by the anime because those teams fit each Frontier Brain really well. Also, I decided not have repeating types, so each Frontier Brain’s type will be unique to them.

Noland - Bug (Doesn’t have a canonical team, but because he has a Pinsir in Pokémon Masters I went with Bug.)

Greta - Fighting (Has a Heracross and Breloom in the games, and a Hariyama and Medicham in the anime. She also gives off the vibe of being a Fighting-Type trainer with her stance and her belt.)

Tucker - Fire (Has a Charizard in the games and an Arcanine in the anime. Also, he is known for being a performer, and Fire seems to be a fitting type for someone who is flashy in front of a crowd.)

Lucy - Poison (She likes snakes, and people often think of poison or venom when they think of snakes. Seviper is also arguably her most iconic Pokémon and appears both in the games and the anime.)

Spenser - Grass (If we forget about the two Grass types he had in the anime, Spenser just seems like a Grass type user due to his fondness for nature.)

Anabel - Psychic (Aside from having 3 Psychic types in the anime, I just think Psychic fits her well. She has this very elite vibe about her that makes her seem like she has some natural gift for raising powerful Pokémon, and the Psychic type matches that vibe. She also has a purple aesthetic, which helps.)

Brandon - Rock (He’s portrayed as a treasure hunter or a explorer of ancient ruins. We know that he has a Regirock and an anime-exclusive Solrock, but I can also see him with Pokémon like Aerodactyl or Relicanth due to his theme.)

Thornton - Steel (Again, he doesn’t have a canon team, but he does use a Bronzong in Pokémon Masters. He also seems like he would use a Magnezone.)

Dahlia - Ghost (Almost went with Flying because of her Togekiss and Zapdos. However, she does have a Dusknoir, and I could see her with a Drifblim or Mismagius. The Ghost type also kind of matches her hair, which I admit really isn’t saying much since lots of characters have dark black hair.)

Darach - Dark (Houndoom is an iconic Pokémon of his and the Dark type has yet to be used by any other Frontier Brain.)

Palmer - Normal (To me he just looks like he would specialize in the Normal type. Also, he has a Regigigas, and for some reason I can picture him with a Porygon-Z.)

Argenta - Dragon (This one was difficult because she doesn’t have a canon team and she’s not in Pokémon Masters. To decide, I considered which types have yet to be used by other Frontier Brains, which are: Water, Electric, Ice, Flying, Dragon, Ground, and Fairy. I chose to exclude Fairy because that type didn’t exist when Argenta was prevalent. I then narrowed it down to Flying and Dragon because the only Pokémon she’s been confirmed to use in any source of media is Dragonite in the manga.

I played Pokémon (every single gen) since a very young age. My brother hooked me up with an emulator on my PC.

I vaguely remember in one of the older versions, I entered a cave to progress the game (can’t remember which cave) and I came across 3 Pokémon (they look like dogs/wolves) standing side by side. If you approach any one of them and interact, you will start a battle. As soon as you try and catch the Pokémon or/and attack it, it flees.

Once the battle screen fades, all three of the Pokémon run off and you cant find them again, Am I imagining it? I was about 9-10 years old when first playing it. It was one of the older games.

Digimon Adventure 2020,digimon,"I just finished adventure 2020 (I know I’m late) and honestly I got… a lot of thoughts. Everything felt really off to me and I couldn’t put my finger on it but now I think I know why I thought adventure 2020 was underwhelming. So even though nobody asked for it, here’s a little review of mine:

First off I wanna say some things I really loved. Obviously the animation is beautiful, I appreciate the more fluent evolution sequences, too. Also the whole Ancient War storyline is ingenious. Giving our main Digimon past lives where they were great warriors and even have them face that past on occasion (like Gabumom did) was brilliant. I also adore the alternative evolution lines. Evolution is circumstantial and it works. I was really hyped when Omegamon suddenly had BlitGreymon and CressGarurumom appendices and basically the blade and gun switched. It was awesome. Also giving everybody megas was definitely the right call.

Sooo what went wrong in my opinion? My biggest 2 problems are the Crests and the fact that it doesn’t really work on its own.

It’s a reboot and still things only really make sense sometimes when you’ve watched the original. Like the part about Koushiro‘s parents, it’s never stated he is adopted. You only know from watching the original. And a lot of character benefits like how Takeru get’s a lot done on his own only feels satisfying because we know it wasn’t like this in the original. If you don’t consider that 90s Takeru had struggles being independent, 2020 Takeru doing things on his own just wouldn’t hit nearly as hard. But it’s worst when it comes to the Crests. Many character moments only work because we know what the crests mean long before the show explains what they are.

Speaking of the crests:
I didn’t mind that they weren’t objects to wear, honestly the amulets would’ve looked weird anyway on the modern designs. But I mind that they aren’t earned. Think about it we never find out what each crest stands for so and neither do the kids. So the entire idea of having to live up to the crest is gone.

Taichi isn’t abusing his courage because he doesn’t need to be courages for the evolution to work. I also don’t get why the crest of courage demands for him to check on his friends all the time. Should’ve been Yamato or Sora or not crest related. But his courage vision Valkyrimon moment was great.

Yamato the lone Wolf who has to learn the meaning of friendship is alone for what 3 episodes or so? And bam he’s part of the group. 

Sora fighting with Piyomon to protect her was great. Only problem: the original did it and did it better. Sora thinking her crest of love will never work, her problems with her mother all culminating to her realising she was loved because she does the same to Piyomon out of love is gone. I like the fact that she gets her crest at the end though and not when she reaches her mega. The volcano plot just didn’t feel earned.

Takeru‘s plot was fantastic in idea, wanting to help a digimon reach its sanctuary because he misses his own. Not giving up. Hope growing wings. It felt a little rushed though.

Jyou‘s story worked too. It was just way less significant to almost drowning trying to keep a promise.

Mimi‘s story about the school and purity was among the best. Especially since the purity was actually a goal set to achieve. Too bad we didn’t know she had the crest of purity.

Hikari really did embody light and life. Arguably more so than in the original. No complaints there. 

Koushiro solving riddles was a nice concept as well.

You see the quests for the crests themselves are not the problem. The problem is our characters just do their thing and happen to aquire the crests because of who they are. There is no idea of knowing what the crest means and having to work to grow into it. There was no character development and so there was little pay off.

One last thing I wasn’t so sure about was the digivices. The communication function is great and very useful. Only problem it reduces the scale of the world and adventure. Almost everybody has a flying digimon early on and can always find out where the others are so there is no being lost, the separation isn’t a risk but hardly inconvenient. I love how in the original they have to be close by to track each other. So they do run into each other but coming back together isn’t like meeting your friends at the mall.

All in all the reboot feels like a small scale sidequest with little accomplishment instead of well an Adventure.",Digimon Adventure 2020 ,digimon adventure ,digimon adventure ,2

I remember Mimi was my first anime crush(LOL) and for a while as a kid I would wear goggles on my head like Tai. While everyone else was stuck on Pokémon I would watch Digimon. The last scene I couldn’t help but cry and think back to when I was that kid, I must’ve looked crazy to everyone. When Agumon looked at Tai realizing how big he’s gotten, and Matt playing the harmonica while gabumon just has his eyes closed listening and vibing. Felt like I said Goodbye to apart of my childhood, I’m glad they made this movie for us 90’s kids. From the bottom of my heart Thank You ❤️",Just watched Digimon Last Evolution… ,just watched digimon last evolution,just watched digimon last evolution,5

"Digimon ""Appli Universe"" is a 7/10 give/take",digimon,"I watched it this month for the 1st time and I enjoyed it except a few thing mainly the protaginst, the abilities, and the ending.

Reminder, I did enjoy it but I thought it would be easier for me to mention the things that I dislike.

1- Protaginst, he is a little too naive. He asks from the enemy something and expects them to do as he says .. goku from dragon ball is much smarter than him tbh. At the last arc SPOILERS >!His android friend keeps telling him through logic and reasons that he was being manipulated since they were kids because of his relationship to his grandfather and then they can throw him. Not only that, but also he allowed his android friend to 1 hit bootmon, corrupt him, bring that appmon that I forgot his name, and by extension leviation. Who needs the world and friends when you can have mental shock for 2 episodes, am I right? Sorry it just seemed a little too stupid!<


2- The abilities were really nice, to make the partner engaed in the fight somehow. However only 1 of the main cast used it constantly because that's his trait while the main character only used it once during the final 3 episodes and that's it. It was underutilized way too much also SPOILERS >!Did the android guy used an ability?? Because I don't recall that!<


3-The ending was kind of anti-climactic, as in I was expecting something like xros wars final fight, adventure 1, 2, tamers, adventure reboot, or even frontier. But no, it ended like shaman king 2021 ((kind of, but not really)). SPOILERS FOR BOTH >!you set up the cast and give them huge power up levels? Check. You give them an OP final boss? Check. You win by attacking altogether? Nope. You win by diplomacy-no-jutsu? Check!<

Things that need to be adressed peoperly.,digimon,"I can't for the life of me understand how they're going to be able to explain some big questions in two episodes?

1- GulusGammamon's mystery

This alone definitely needs a full episode to explain everything surrounding GulusGammamon like his past in the digital world, his association with Gammamon, his true motives and intentions. I'm afraid that we might not get a satisfying unswer in the next episode since it's likely to be revolved around the fight with BloomLordmon that might take 6-8 minutes of the episode's runtime which might result in a rushed explanation of Gulus's mystery which definitely plays a key role in Regulusmon's appearance. 


2- The time limit thing.

I thought they might explain this one last episode but they haven't so far and it definitely needs to be brought up and explained properly. 


3- Black Agumon, Black Galgomon and Black Growmon.


This one is the most I'm afraid about being explained in a half-assed way, they definitely have had something to do with Gulus from the beginning hence watching the situation from afar every time he shows up, and if we notice properly they don't have GulusGammamon's colour scheme on their bodies like Dagomon, Rafflesimon, Kuwagamon and Brakimon do.


I can't accept something like simply them being infected by the black corrosion, otherwise what would be the point of bringing them during all GulusGammamon's appearances particularly his latest one where all 3 of them gathered at once when Gulus asked Hiro to sync with him.","Things that need to be adressed peoperly.

At first I thought it was just fan art but for whatever reason I dug into it a little and found out about Adventure Tri. Decided ""wth"" I'll watch it I haven't watched Digimon in forever. Watched it, immediately fell back in love with it all, jumped on Hulu and watched the original series and 02, watched Tri again, watched Last Evolution, now I play Cyber Sleuth, now I play the TCG, I even bought a 3D printer so I could print (among other things) Digimon figurines. Also having grown up with the American version I had never heard the absolute bangers Butterfly and Brave Heart, but thankfully Tri had them included even in the dub. I also appreciated the use of the Digi-rap remix or whatever at the beginning as that was a nice dose of American Digimon nostalgia before getting to experience the *really* good music. The rest of the series is great, I loved Last Evolution even though I damn near balled my eyes out at the end, but something about Tri and the way it brought me back into Digimon after more than a decade makes it really special (even if now that I know more about the series again I can see the plot holes and all that haha)","Despite it's Flaws, Adventure Tri might be my favorite part of the OG series ",despite its flaws adventure tri might be my favorite part of the og series,despite its flaws adventure tri might be my favorite part of the og series,14

What is the best game currently for you?,digimon,"I'm a 30+ yo fan of Digimon stuff since my childhood and beyond, happy to see the revival of the franchise. Unfortunately, Digimon World: Next Order is ridiculously expensive on Steam.

For my amusement, I remembered that Digimon Story: Lost Evolution was translated this year and that there is a Digimon World 2 hackrom (one of my favorite games after Digimon World decades ago when i was a kid) called ""Digimon World 2 Alternative"".

That leads to the question here.

What are your favorite or best Digimon games or the ones that you remember that have been the most fun/interesting for you?

The most entertaining Digimon World, Digimon Story, Digimon Rumble arena, Card battle, fangame, etc.

Have a pretty cool week!

EDIT: typo.
Edit 2: why the downvotes? Nice people here heh.
Edit 3: Loved the comments, thanks ppl! <3","What is the best game currently for you? What it says on the tin.  What is it that you play (or used to play) Pokemon for?  Story?  Gameplay?  Exploration?  Music?  Competitive? 

I started with Pokemon Gen 2 (Silver),  so I got spoiled right off the gate with a really dense, content-rich experience as my first Pokemon game, which also shaped my perspective on what a Pokemon game should be:  An RPG game that opens up the world to you, to explore every little nook and cranny, with lots of optional, but engaging, content to indulge in, as well as some non-linear progression for you to customize your adventure.  Let's break down Gen 2's progression style:

* It's linear up until Ecruteak City, after which you have the choice to go left towards Olivine and Cianwood or right to Mahogany and Lake of Rage.  Both are required (along with the Rocket Radio Tower Takeover) to finish the game, and you converge at Blackthorn City for the final badge.  Once you reach Kanto in the post-game, the entire region is open to you to complete in whatever order you desire, minus the Power Plant sidequest to open up Western Kanto.
* Optional areas (meaning you don't even have to set foot in them one time to complete the game):  Dark Cave (all three entrances), Ruins of Alph (and the second half of Union Cave), Whirl Islands, Tin Tower, Mt. Mortar, routes below Blackthorn City, most of Kanto's routes and caves (even moreso in HGSS, since Cerulean Cave and Seafoam Islands were restored).
* The caves that are present here are all dense and multi-floor, labyrinthine and have puzzles to solve (Strength puzzles in some caves, sliding ice puzzles in Ice Path).

So with such a dense experience as my first game, clearly an exploration heavy game, this is what I've come to expect from every title I'd play after this.  I actually played Gen 1 (Red) after Silver, and immediately felt the downgrade in terms of quality of life and what not, but it at least still offered that sense of exploration, and non-linear progression, which starts after you emerge from Rock Tunnel after the first three badges.

Then I would play Gen 3, and it was underwhelming, but still decent, especially Emerald with the Battle Frontier.  Coming off Gen 2 and its sheer content and feature richness, going to Gen 3 and seeing all the removed features for no apparent reason (like Day and Night, and animated Pokemon from Crystal, and the Radio, and no second region to explore) is what made it feel underwhelming to me.  But little did I know, this was actually the start of the series removing features every Generation, with no real reason as to why.

Gen 4 (Platinum is what I played) was pretty nice as well, and has plenty of nooks and crannies to explore, and optional areas.  The post-game with the Battle Area felt like a mini-region on its own to explore, since you could also do that in a non-linear fashion. 

Gen 5 (Black 1 is what I played, followed by White 2) is where I started to notice the shift in the design philosophy of Pokemon games.  Since these were the most story focused games at the time, they heavily sacrificed the ability to explore the region for this.  Not only that, but the map was a literal straight line to the Pokemon league, since the right half of the circle was closed off until the post-game.  The areas did at least feel dense still, and I did notice that all the optional sections were behind the HMs; I don't think you're required to use an HM to get through the main game.   Black and White 2 was much the same, but I was at least happy to see all the additional polish added to the presentation of these games.  Everyone finally animated, including all the generic trainers and even us, if you were in a wifi battle against another player.   I fell off the series after this game though.

It wasn't until Gen 8 (Shield I played specifically) that I tried to return...and that was when I really realized that the games just don't really care about exploration anymore.  That was the most boring, linear Pokemon game I've played yet; even more linear than Gen 5, which I didn't think was possible.  But what made it worse was that there's virtually no optional areas to explore in the game (DLC not included, only talking about the base game here), compounded with the fact that there were no longer any dungeons in the game either.  The only two caves in Galar are both hallways, and single-floor.  The only ""dungeon,"" if you can even call it that, was also just an elevator ride.   I think it was at this point that I started to realize that Pokemon is probably no longer a series about exploring anymore, and is just focused on whatever story they want to tell.  But, being a gameplay first gamer that wants to explore, obviously I don't care about a Pokemon story, so none of the 3D titles have appealed to me since.",what is the best game currently for you,what is the best game currently for you what it says on the tin what is it that you play or used to play pokemon for story gameplay exploration music competitive i started with pokemon gen  silver so i got spoiled right off the gate with a really dense contentrich experience as my first pokemon game which also shaped my perspective on what a pokemon game should be an rpg game that opens up the world to you to explore every little nook and cranny with lots of optional but engaging content to indulge in as well as some nonlinear progression for you to customize your adventure lets break down gen s progression style  its linear up until ecruteak city after which you have the choice to go left towards olivine and cianwood or right to mahogany and lake of rage both are required along with the rocket radio tower takeover to finish the game and you converge at blackthorn city for the final badge once you reach kanto in the postgame the entire region is open to you to complete in whatever order you desire minus the power plant sidequest to open up western kanto  optional areas meaning you dont even have to set foot in them one time to complete the game dark cave all three entrances ruins of alph and the second half of union cave whirl islands tin tower mt mortar routes below blackthorn city most of kantos routes and caves even moreso in hgss since cerulean cave and seafoam islands were restored  the caves that are present here are all dense and multifloor labyrinthine and have puzzles to solve strength puzzles in some caves sliding ice puzzles in ice path so with such a dense experience as my first game clearly an exploration heavy game this is what ive come to expect from every title id play after this i actually played gen  red after silver and immediately felt the downgrade in terms of quality of life and what not but it at least still offered that sense of exploration and nonlinear progression which starts after you emerge from rock tunnel after the first three badges then i would play gen  and it was underwhelming but still decent especially emerald with the battle frontier coming off gen  and its sheer content and feature richness going to gen  and seeing all the removed features for no apparent reason like day and night and animated pokemon from crystal and the radio and no second region to explore is what made it feel underwhelming to me but little did i know this was actually the start of the series removing features every generation with no real reason as to why gen  platinum is what i played was pretty nice as well and has plenty of nooks and crannies to explore and optional areas the postgame with the battle area felt like a miniregion on its own to explore since you could also do that in a nonlinear fashion gen  black  is what i played followed by white  is where i started to notice the shift in the design philosophy of pokemon games since these were the most story focused games at the time they heavily sacrificed the ability to explore the region for this not only that but the map was a literal straight line to the pokemon league since the right half of the circle was closed off until the postgame the areas did at least feel dense still and i did notice that all the optional sections were behind the hms i dont think youre required to use an hm to get through the main game black and white  was much the same but i was at least happy to see all the additional polish added to the presentation of these games everyone finally animated including all the generic trainers and even us if you were in a wifi battle against another player i fell off the series after this game though it wasnt until gen  shield i played specifically that i tried to returnand that was when i really realized that the games just dont really care about exploration anymore that was the most boring linear pokemon game ive played yet even more linear than gen  which i didnt think was possible but what made it worse was that theres virtually no optional areas to explore in the game dlc not included only talking about the base game here compounded with the fact that there were no longer any dungeons in the game either the only two caves in galar are both hallways and singlefloor the only dungeon if you can even call it that was also just an elevator ride i think it was at this point that i started to realize that pokemon is probably no longer a series about exploring anymore and is just focused on whatever story they want to tell but being a gameplay first gamer that wants to explore obviously i dont care about a pokemon story so none of the d titles have appealed to me since,8

the routes sound courageous and adventurous, as if the game is pushing you forward and encouraging you to explore the tall grass and challenge enemy trainers.

the dungeon themes are eerie and menacing, yet they keep a steady beat that fits in any location, from dark damp caves to abandoned houses and facilities.

the battle themes are just perfect. the wild battle theme is a more robust and basic version of the the trainer theme. it signals danger but its simplicity also represents how the pokemon youre battling is untrained and spontaneous. the trainer theme is of course the exact opposite; an intense symphony that doesnt yield until youve won. both of these themes play throughout the entire game and not once do they become dull to listen to.

Is he to drasil what Hackmon is to homeostasis? 

Also.... what happened to himekawa? She get murdered by those fish digimon? She was just wandering the digital world or what? 

How do the kids explain what happened to ishijima? He just disappeared? I don't think people will take ""sacrifice"" as an answer. 

Lastly.... who the hell were the other 2 kids in pods that Tai found? I thought there were only 4 kids in the second series. There were 6 in pods. One of them was shaped like Kari from the second series for some reason. I just dont know who the hell they were.

Of course, out of universe, it's your typical McGuffin to allow Kyurem to fuse and explain why it couldn't before but really think about it. What are they?

I'm reading over the BW2 script and I'm not finding any answers for this. Admittedly, this is an issue with the other McGuffins like the Weather Orbs or the Creation Orbs but at least the fusion items excluding the DNA Splicers were given some explanation. The N-rizers are machines made by Colress to simulate the effects of Necrozma stealing Solgaleo/Lunala's light and the Reins Of Unity are a specially crafted item made for royalty which allows Calyrex to tame its respective steed the same way a human tames a horse. There's a logic there but there isn't really one with the DNA Splicers.

So what's their deal? Are they a part of Kyurem and if so, how did people find them and learn what they do?

Bancho Onee-sama - Artist: 一平 (@gtmwd262),digimon,,"Bancho Onee-sama - Artist: 一平 (@gtmwd262) So here's what perplexes me greatly, we have pokemon, and we have humans. 

There are references to real world animals, which makes your presume animals that are not pokemon, due exist in the pokemon world. But in the shows, we also see very few examples. Probably because pokemon evolved from these creatures. And we know that Arceus, known as a God level entity, is considered a pokemon as we can capture it's avatars. We also know there are extradimensional aliens, that we can also capture as pokemon, and not just in specialized balls. 

But how long has Arceus been around? We know it was there and exists before the time of Hisui and it's said to have created everything. But what exactly IS a pokemon. Did humans, which as primates, come from the same evolutionary lines as earth humans? Or were they just made as human. Why are humans immune to pokeballs? We even see in Hisui that the pokeballs don't have a human noncapture protocol programmed because tech was not of that level. So humans are fundamentally not pokemon. 

Except...when they are. We see from many examples that people do become pokemon. I.E. most ghost types, which would mean that the possibility of the DNA not being a pokemon, but the human is? There are also examples of humans becoming Kadabras, or even isekai'd into it, like the mystery dungeons.

So what makes a pokemon, what it is, and how did humans rise to power in a world that isn't ours? We do know that Arceus enjoys battles. Like the Eternal Battle Reverie in Legends: Arceus. But humans aren't needed to cause pokemon battles. Like wild creatures, the battles can easily happen between species. And we aren't needed to bring out the potential of a pokemon. Others evolve and grow in power without human interaction. 

But it also comes to the question, we know that Arceus is the pokemon God. But... is he our God?  Did Arceus create humans? That part has always been obscure. Was that intentional? Are we immune to the pokemon affects because humans aren't Arceus' children? But something else's children? Maybe that is why humans have to either die, or be transformed into a pokemon.

It had all 721 Pokémon caught. not only that, but I checked the copies of USUM I bought, and they shared the same trainer name as AS. All of them were owned by ""Andrew"". The first time they ran through the Elite four, was way back in on February 5, 2015. Salamance, Blaziken, Manetric, Gyrados, Latias, and Sceptile.   


Now after the shock and excitement cleared, I realized that they had obtained Arceus, which is impossible to my knowledge to obtain in 3DS games, except through the GameStop Promo. It had  an all red Pokeball and an original trainer with the name ""GF"". Now, something that made me wonder if maybe the game had been hacked was that they had 990 masterballs, and several legendaries and mythicals had been caught using the masterball. ""Technically"" you could trade a pokemon with a MB as a held item from one 3ds to another, however the sheer ammount of time that would take is insane and leads me to believe the game was hacked with a homebrewed 3ds or something of the like.

**198: Murkrow**

Surprisingly for the bird girl... I do not actually like Murkrow all that much. I think a huge part of this is how little emphasis the bird puts on it's wings, and it's general scrawny appearance where most of it's body is the head. It looks too much like a bobblehead and too cartoonish for me to take seriously or appreciate the witchy symbolism. The head to body ratio really bugs me waaaaay more than it should, and combined with it's gangly talons and beak and the strange unnatural hat brim, I just can't get behind this creature even if I adore both corvids and witches. 

I do want to compliment the tail though. It's very creative to give it the tuft of a broomstick aesthetic so the hat brim doesn't feel totally isolated. Seeing that I'm totally fine with that hat on Honchkrow though, I think it's just more of a consequence of really disliking Murkrow's head. It's just... it's so cartoony, I can't take it seriously! It doesn't look intimidating due to it's scrawniness and lack of mysticism in it's design, nor is it cute or graceful. It's just kind of... a design.

As harsh as I'm sounding though, I cannot put the concept of a witchy corvid Pokémon down too far - it's a **C Tier** to me. Strong concept, below average execution. As a design, it feels out of place and unfinished, and - oh yeah! It's another Johto single stage that clearly does not look fully evolved. Thankfully we get Honchkrow later - and yeeeeeaaah. I know that's going to be a major hot take. I'm bracing myself already.

a cool area idea for my DnDigimon idea,digimon,"So, I've been working off and on for my future Digimon DND campaign, and an area I'm really excited about getting to is an area within Greymon-species territory but close to the border that separates it from Dramon-species territory. When the players first get there they see railways before coming across an amusement park named ChuChewChooLand, the welcome signs and other signs showing a chibi designed Chumon winking. Now the digimon within the park are usually stages between baby1 up to champion, with one ultimate also showing up in signs, but nowhere to be seen in person in the park. Loads of agumons are here of all kinds, snow, black, toy, 2006 variants, and agumon nise also shows up in signs. Several Railmon are also around. The owner of the park is a Chumon named Mike (haha funny) and he is frequently seen running around the park either filling up stock on paraphernalia or talking to visitors. Nise Agumon on the other hand stays in a single area where he tells purposely bad jokes with a lot of slapstick. Now, there are bits of stuff around that normally wouldn't be in an amusement park, such as military barricades and multiple weapons closets.

When the players investigate around, they find that many of the digimon here don't know what they're talking about with the military stuff since they're just visitors for the most part. If they ask Nise Agumon he'll just tell them to buzz off and Chumon is very avoidant of the issue telling them to just enjoy the park, that's the whole reason it exists. It's not until they leave that they get accosted and possibly apprehended by some other digimon hiding outside the park. They see the classic poop digimon such as Numemon and Scumon as well as some various mechanical digimon. They're lead to the leader of this group, Tyutyumon and Damemon. They learn that this area previously used to be a military research facility and training camp, but Chumon got fed up with doing training. He sabotaged the camp by finding the code that controlled the immediate area and changed it all into an amusement park, bringing up some old Golemons to push everyone out. The barricades and weapons are still there as they weren't originally part of the area, and keeping them locked up keeps them away from the original group. So the players have a choice of either leaving or assisting in restoring the area back to how it was before. If they choose to assist and succeed, they'll get to hear how the Chumon wanted to make an area where noone had to worry about the war going on, he sees that he may have been in the wrong with his method. He'll relinquish control back to Tyutyumon. Tyutyumon will reward the group with a pair of Mechanorimon.

The most pointless character in Ghost Game,digimon,"Why in the world do the writers hate Ryudamon so much?

His debut episode was nonsensical and probably one of the worst ones in all of Ghost Game, which is funny as it introduced the idea of the Digivice being capable of purifying Digimon (something that might not even matter at all), and also had some of the worst interactions between Hiro and Ruli and Kiyo. But fine, that's subjective.

What's not subjective is the fact that his evolution was way too quick and random, his evolution episode wasn't focused on him, nor did he even get to fight in it, and he's done nothing aside from being a mount for the past 10+ episodes. These last few episodes, where Ginryumon FINALLY appeared again, he's done basically nothing and said nothing. Even when the group decides they'll go to the Digital World and defeat the great threat, a freaking Floramon got more lines than Ginryumon, who got to watch from the side like a child in detention. The second he evolved, he was relegated to just being a second Airdramon from the group (mind you, Espimon basically just became a THIRD Airdramon for the group upon evolving, but at least he gets some screentime and the group actually remembers he's one of their friends).

I know asking for Ryudamon to become Aoi or Maki's partner or something is a little much, and it's fine that he's not part of the climax in the Digital World, but he added so little to the show that you could basically just replace him with the Flying Nimbus from DB and you'd have the same thing. Honestly, that's insulting to the Flying Nimbus because it has more story and character than Ryudamon. Ryudamon's another character who the writers added despite having no clue of what to do with him, and they just gave up on him after a couple of episodes. Unironically, he could have added more to the story had Hiro and Gammamon had to kill him back in episode 40 or whenever the hell he showed up.

Ryudamon and his evolutions are awesome too, so it's just such a freaking waste. Then again, it's not like he's the character the writers hate most...

Sora vs Zoe in a boxing match,digimon,"ATTENTION LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!!

In the Red Corner, we have, the Digidestined of Love, Sora Takenouchi!

In the Blue Corner, we have, the Legendary Warrior of Wind, Zoe Orimoto!

To make this fight fair, Zoe will not use digievolve and Sora won't have Biyomon. Plus they both would be around the same age. Both would also get a boxing outfit and gloves and the fight would take place in a boxing ring. Though, I wonder what their boxing outfits and gloves would look like, maybe you guys can answer down in the comments below.

Now, LET'S GET READY TO RUMBBLEEE!!!!!

(And then Hackmon told them that they either choose Meicoomon or civilization being hit back to the stone age with no guarantee that Meicoomon won't infect anything again or if Meiko would be considered a pariah for housing a world-wiper)

Digimon Super Groups,digimon,"What are the digimon super groups, like the Olympus XII, Seven Great Demon Lords, 10 Ancient Warriors, Royal Knights, Etc…","Digimon Super Groups My reasoning for Virizion being a male is the following: swords of justice are based on the musketeers, virizion is based on Aramis who, even though he was a male, was the most  elegant, feminine, vain, romantic and well groomed out of them, this and the musketeers being all males, leads me to  think that virizion could be a male despite it's feminine looks, the only think that could lead us to believe Virizion being a female is the voice acting in the movie Kyurem vs the sword of justice in Wich Virizion has a feminine voice, but even then, Manaphy, the Prince of seas is given a more feminine voice in the anime despite it being refered as a prince, not a princess, I am by no means a Pokemon expert and I'm sure that my theory may be easily debunked but what do you think ?

Digimon Seekers,digimon,"I think seekers has the potential to be the best digimon story of all time although it’s unfortunate that it isn’t a game or an anime.

Strongest Of the Demon Lords,digimon,"So I’ve tried to get into it, but the Digimon lore is really confusing, especially strength wise, but I was looking at the Seven Great Demon Lords, because I’m edgy like that, and I was wondering if there was any official statement of the ranking of their power.

Including alternate forms and their X-antibody forms.","Strongest Of the Demon Lords Because if you haven’t heard the recent news, there’s a bug where if you connect Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to Pokémon Go or downloaded the DLC, the bug will literally *delete your save file data*.

This only happened to a couple of people though, and while I think just updating to version 1.2.0, will do that too, I’m honestly super glad I didn’t download the DLC, or connected to Pokémon Go. I would’ve probably had hundreds of hours of hard work flushed down the toilet. I would *not* be happy. But I’m gonna lay off on Violet for a while, hopefully this issue gets fixed soon, because I’m too scared.

Headcanon about the Crests,digimon,"I had this idea way back when that the Crests could be like a zodiac for the Digital world. Basically each crest has a certain group of time that may or may not affect those born under that sign. For instance, that Drimogemon that was fought in the early episodes of Savers could have been born under the Knowledge Crest (or the ""Month of Knowledge, if you prefer) and that's what allowed it to digivolve to Digmon. As for the special Crests (like Miracles and Fate/Destiny), those months could come around every few years, kind of like leap years but a little more.

What should I watch (or maybe play) after Ghost Game ends?,digimon,"My friend got me into digimon a while back, and I watched Adventure and Adventure 02 before deciding that Ghost Game seemed like the exact sort of thing I would absolutely love (which it is. it feels like it was custom made to cater to my interests. i love it). I'm still huffing copium and in denial about it ending so soon, but just in case I'm wrong, what else can I watch (or play, if you have a game recommendation) after it ends? I really love the horror of Ghost Game, so anything similar to that would be absolutely perfect.

I should also mention, I know Tamers is super popular, so this is probably going to be an unpopular opinion, but I've seen the first 10 or so episodes and so far I really don't know if I can get into it. I've tried, I really have, but my ADHD-plagued attention span can only take so much, and when I don't particularly care about most of the cast, it feels like more of a chore to get through than something I enjoy spending my free time on. I'm sure it's good, it just isn't what I'm looking for in a digimon series, I guess.","What should I watch (or maybe play) after Ghost Game ends? 
As much as I like Pokémon art, there is one thing about the art community that I dislike, and those are the fakemon and the “redesigns”.

First off, I know how much work goes into making fakemon or creating redesigns, and I don’t want work like that to be discredited, and I’m not saying ALL fakemon designs are bad, I’ve seen a few good ones. However I do have some criticisms about modern fakemon and Pokémon redesigns.

Fakemon tend to be designed to look cool and not unique, and that’s one of the problems I have with Fakemon designs.

I simply find fakemon to be quite bland and devoid of any unique personality except “Rawr I’m an edgy cool over the top monster”, many people say, “Oh this fakemon looks so much better than the Pokémon in the games we have today”, and while that may be true, fakemon AREN’T Pokémon. 

Pokemon are unique due to their balance in design, they aren’t made to look too cool or too cute, they are supposed to look like something that a child can bond with and most importantly they are supposed to be memorable. I can’t recall the many times I’ve seen a thousand fakemon designs on Instagram that were just an over the top edgy dragon/monster thingy. 

A sub category of fakemon that I strongly dislike are the ones who redesign the Pokémon, and at times claim to have “fix” a Pokémon’s design. 

Now I honestly think that the process of redesigning a character sounds like a fun thing to do, technically regional forms and the paradox forms can be considered “redesigns”. However I dislike the way that most artists redesign Pokémon, and it’s the same thing with how they design Fakemon, over the top, edgy, and bland, only except they are putting these qualities on Pokémon already exist. The same goes for artists who do regional forms too, if you count regional forms as redesigns. 

To conclude, I respect the work that goes into making fakemon or redesigning Pokemon, but I simply find most designs are bland and devoid of creativity. 

Dare I say it but part of me gets annoyed seeing artists pumping out the cookie cutter formula of making a generic anime monster and labeling it as a Pokémon, regional/paradox form, or a redesign.",what should i watch or maybe play after ghost game ends,what should i watch or maybe play after ghost game ends as much as i like pokémon art there is one thing about the art community that i dislike and those are the fakemon and the redesigns first off i know how much work goes into making fakemon or creating redesigns and i dont want work like that to be discredited and im not saying all fakemon designs are bad ive seen a few good ones however i do have some criticisms about modern fakemon and pokémon redesigns fakemon tend to be designed to look cool and not unique and thats one of the problems i have with fakemon designs i simply find fakemon to be quite bland and devoid of any unique personality except rawr im an edgy cool over the top monster many people say oh this fakemon looks so much better than the pokémon in the games we have today and while that may be true fakemon arent pokémon pokemon are unique due to their balance in design they arent made to look too cool or too cute they are supposed to look like something that a child can bond with and most importantly they are supposed to be memorable i cant recall the many times ive seen a thousand fakemon designs on instagram that were just an over the top edgy dragonmonster thingy a sub category of fakemon that i strongly dislike are the ones who redesign the pokémon and at times claim to have fix a pokémons design now i honestly think that the process of redesigning a character sounds like a fun thing to do technically regional forms and the paradox forms can be considered redesigns however i dislike the way that most artists redesign pokémon and its the same thing with how they design fakemon over the top edgy and bland only except they are putting these qualities on pokémon already exist the same goes for artists who do regional forms too if you count regional forms as redesigns to conclude i respect the work that goes into making fakemon or redesigning pokemon but i simply find most designs are bland and devoid of creativity dare i say it but part of me gets annoyed seeing artists pumping out the cookie cutter formula of making a generic anime monster and labeling it as a pokémon regionalparadox form or a redesign,11

"interested in Digimon, question about the games",digimon,"I missed the boat on Digimon for most of my life and recently tried Cyber Sleuth for a bit. I liked the game, setting, music, and a lot of the Digimon I came across. But I also got pretty confused by the evolution mechanics and such, especially with later evolutions

I also started watching the original Japanese version of the first show (I forget how far I got into it before life got in the way) and ended up really liking how each of the kids had only their one respective Digimon that they were bonded with. I thought that was pretty awesome in comparison to the ""collect'em all"" type of thing that most mon games do

Are there any games in the Digimon series that work that way? Where you only have one Digimon (and their evolutions and such)? 

I actually had had this same thought back when all this was first on my mind, and I went as far as to get the re-released virtual pet (got the yellow one), which I was into for a while before, again, life got in the way.

Digimon World: Next Order. Disappointing?,digimon,"So I’ve been a digimon fan all my life. Really enjoyed Digimon Survive, thought it was a clever twist on the franchise. However, I was left feeling confused and wanting more with Next Order. I wasn’t a fan of the battle mechanics, found it too “clunky” and for the first hour I played, didn’t really know what I was doing and just running around. 
Wonder if anyone else has felt this? And if anyone has passed the early parts of the game and can assure me that it gets better ??","Digimon World: Next Order. Disappointing? Hello everyone, so it appears to be Decidueye for the next raid event starting on march 13 iirc with the wind tera type.

As well as Greninja, we can't really know which kind of skills Decidueye will have (Special or Physical ?), BUT, knowing Decidueye's skill set, which will be composed of spirit shackle as ghost type, a naturally wind attack and a grass attack with a dark attack and/or set-up moves such as nasty plot/sword dance/double team, and his stats where he has 107 Phy. ATK for 100 Spe. ATK, we can assume that Decidueye will mostly be Physical than Special in his raid.

Considering these facts, and knowing the table type, 2 types should shine against him which are Electric and Ice types.

With these 2 types, and knowing how hard Decidueye will probably hit, we can find that Baxcalibur and Cetitan can be pretty useful Ice tanks (while also dealing strong physical damages to Decidueye as it's physical bulk is pretty low (75)). These two ice pokemon are also quicker than Decidueye (only 70 speed for Decidueye while Baxcalibur hits 87 and Cetitan 73 but can hit even higher with the ability named Slush Rush for Cetitan under snow. Baxcalibur gets a HP Regen with his ability named Ice Body making him more tanky). 

For the electric type, it's pretty hard to find one that will do the job correctly with the list of Pokemon we currently have in S/V, but Miraidon seems to be the most perfect one even though he deals Special damages (Decidueye's Spe Def is at 100 so pretty high).

For the sets I've thought about so far with these 3 Pokemons, here they are :

Miraidon : 
- Taunt
- Parabolic Charge
- Electro Drift
- Reflect/Light Screen/Calm Mind (depends on what you need)

As for the item, I recommend something that will make your Electric terrain last longer, or something that will improve his damages such as life orb or the leftovers if necessary.

Baxcalibur :
- Swords Dance
- Snowscape
- Icicle Crash
- Protect/Substitute (if you want to tank one turn or two to set up) / Rest / Ice Fang 

For the item, pick leftovers if necessary, or either an item that'll last the snow longer or boost your damages. If you used Rest as the last skill, take the mint berry to wake up asap so you don't lose turns.

Cetitan :
- Substitute / Rest / ?
- Bellydrum
- Icicle Crash / Ice Spinner
- Snowscape

Cetitan will definitely need some heal after using Bellydrum which is a bit harsh if you take two consecutive hits from Decidueye under special conditions. Use Sitrus berry if you take Substitute (or Shell Bell, but not really helpful imo). If using Rest, then Mint Berry. If you decide to go all in without Substitute or Rest, then good luck and don't forget to take an item that'll boost your damages !

Vamdemon Movie?,digimon,"Vamdemon,  or Myotismon if you prefer, I have a faint memory of seeing a clip on YouTube a few years ago of a scene from a Digimon movie. All I can remember is, the lead character of season 1, 2 and 3 meeting each other with Agumon even getting to meet the Agumon from Digimon Data Squad, I even remember him saying ""Nice to meet you"".

I also remember that they were up against at least five VenomMyotismon. However after an hour of searching, I can't find this. So either it just simply doesn't exist, or it's not a movie not an episode of the show. Or I don't know. It's frustrating.

Few Questions About Next Order,digimon,"So, I finally I can get my hands playing Next Order because for some unique reasons, I can play on PC only, not consoles.

That said, I'm ofc not a new in Digimon Universe, I played majority of Digimon games before & understood how to approach the games. In quick glance I think NO is basically a newer version of DW1 & ReDigitize which I also already played before. I'm usually blind guide type player aka restrict myself from guides or advices. But there's a few questions that I'm really must ask:

1) is there any running option for this game, I mean the Tamer one ofc. The Tamer's movement is so slow & even if I recall NO is an old game, don't tell me I can't run? I mean the world is kinda 'open'-ish, sure comparing for ex Ys Games NO world map is a joke, but running feels a must when exploring nowadays in any games. 

2) since I can see the concepts that in the end you can max ur stats to max with any digimons, am I correct that the 'better' digimon is the one that have fast window animation skills, I recall in Digimon World 1 some digimon attack faster than others because of the animation & the certain skills related. Is this the same case with next order? Ofc I can see if their signature skills seems have different power base level & effects.

Dynasmon line,digimon,,"Dynasmon line while currently the talks are only about shutting down the eshop, I think it isnt really up to imagination if the 3DS online services get shut down, but rather WHEN.

and obviously this would completely shut down A LOT in terms of transfer.

gen3 to 4 obviously works due to the Dual-Cartridge DSes and 4 to 5 works via a local transfer.

However 5 to 6, 6 to 7, as well as 1/2(VC) to 7, as well as 6/7 to further generations are COMPLETELY blocked is bank inevitably someday shuts down too.

&#x200B;

so my proposal for this dilemma is the following:

One thing I omitted in the Gen4 to 5 description is that it is not purely a plain local transfer (similar how gen1 to 2 worked), but rather the DS with the gen4 game gets a piece of software, the Pokeporter from the gen5 game via DS Download Play (some people may remember that Mario Kart DS similarly allowed multiplayer with several people who dont even own the game).

&#x200B;

This technique also exists for the 3DS, although I have no idea if or how much it was used.

However using this one could equally create a 3DS Download Play software that works similar to the pokeporter to move the pokemon but this time to Pokemon home over a switch or possibly even mobile phone.

If the 3DS even allows installing of software via Download play, one could even go super creative and create a local ""pokemon box"" style system to move pokemon locally between the generations including VC games.",dynasmon line,dynasmon line while currently the talks are only about shutting down the eshop i think it isnt really up to imagination if the ds online services get shut down but rather when and obviously this would completely shut down a lot in terms of transfer gen to  obviously works due to the dualcartridge dses and  to  works via a local transfer however  to   to  as well as vc to  as well as  to further generations are completely blocked is bank inevitably someday shuts down too xb so my proposal for this dilemma is the following one thing i omitted in the gen to  description is that it is not purely a plain local transfer similar how gen to  worked but rather the ds with the gen game gets a piece of software the pokeporter from the gen game via ds download play some people may remember that mario kart ds similarly allowed multiplayer with several people who dont even own the game xb this technique also exists for the ds although i have no idea if or how much it was used however using this one could equally create a ds download play software that works similar to the pokeporter to move the pokemon but this time to pokemon home over a switch or possibly even mobile phone if the ds even allows installing of software via download play one could even go super creative and create a local pokemon box style system to move pokemon locally between the generations including vc games,2

"Creative exercise, creating a Digimon cast/team.",digimon,"Used this page for designing a cast, like if it was for a fan made game or history. 

Used the CyberSleuth's icons cuz is the best way to summary they basic data, of course not counting personality. With the Appmons decided to have some creative liberty so added them my head-canon attributes. 

Gatchmon being Neutral-Data due to being a characterization of search engines, like Google or Bing, so Data attribute fits well in it. Offmon has Dark-Virus cuz was antagonist (almost villain) on two versions, but also for they ""Draining Energy"" ability, kinda  similar to a vampire one. 

The rest I think explain themselves, is mostly canon info from the reference book.

Words cannot express how much I love this card,digimon,,"Words cannot express how much I love this card Curse is either one of a kind, or very rare. 

That being; a move that operates COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY depending on which Pokémon uses it; basically one move acting like 2 entirely different moves. 

When most Pokémon use Curse, it’s a simple +1, +1, -1, stat modifier. 

But when a ghost type uses it, it sacrifices health in exchange for strong damage over time. 

Are there any other moves like this? Yes I know there are some with minor differences, but none I can think of that are basically 2 different moves entirely.

**Nothing else to say other than that it’s kinda cool that it’s one of a kind in this way and I never see anyone acknowledge that.

fav digimon in season 1,digimon,,"fav digimon in season 1 I have not seen a single topic about the new Pokémon's potential typings, so here is one :)

Here are my speculations:

* **Munkidori / Machimashiru**

   * This is an unused typing.
   * Monkeys can fling... junk at intruders \^\^; 
* **Okidogi / Iineinu**
   * Ground/Fighting
   * It looks like a brawler.

* **Fezandipiti / Kichikigisu**
   * Grass/Flying

   * Pheasants have long feathers and Fezandipiti looks like it's attuned to nature.
* **Ogerpon**
   * Dark/Ghost
   * It looks like a spirit wearing an Oni mask, so the typing would address both.

Which title should I purchase,digimon,"Digimon world next order or cyber sleuth ? Hackers memory? 
They’re all on sale for 10$ so wanna choose which I shouldn’t get

What’s the difference between cyber sleuth and hackers memory","Which title should I purchase Hey Pokemon players so, I just wanted to share something personal relating to the Pokemon games cause it's been weighing heavy on me. I realize there are limitations to what they really let people post on this subreddit but it would mean a lot to me if this post were allowed, and I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it I was in tears just writing this so, hopefully this story touches someones heart <3 This is the story of Me and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky.  


Anyway, so let's go back to summer 2015. I was in love with a woman named Jess whom I'd known since college, and we were both big Pokemon fans. Once we moved in together, we would wake up on days that we had nothing going on (which was quite often haha) and play on our GBA/DS/3DS with the tv in the background for hours before really getting around to doing anything. It was like our daily ritual! It was 1 of the things early on that really connected us, the love of the Pokemon universe.  


So, 1 day I tell Jess I'm about to replay Explorers of Sky for the first time in a few years. I'd only ever played through it completely twice, as it wasn't THAT old of a game. To my surprise, she had never played it! She did play the original on GBA however. So I ended up getting it on my PC to play on the TV so she could watch me play and take turns playing and enjoying the story. Over the next few days, it was amazing to see her reaction to all the cute little things and all the great twists and turns of the plot of Explorers of Sky! I think we played it for about 6 hours a day for a week straight lol. All of the amazing music from the game was probably her favorite part actually. And after we finished, we would still listen to the music through the jukebox occasionally and go back to grind.  


So teleport us to about 5 months later, she went away to see her family but had to stay there due to her father having a serious health issue, and I couldn't be with her for about 3 weeks, including New Years. I had no idea when she was coming back so it was pretty depressing. But when she was gone I did another replay of that game to pass the time, and found myself really sad playing it without her. The music honestly hurt to hear.

  
The next winter,,,, life was good, we had got engaged on Thanksgiving, and 2 days after Christmas we went to get matching tattoos at a friends house. And then someone hit our car. Yeah,,, she died instantly, it obviously was the worst thing that's ever happened to me. I was alone again on New Years, and all I could think about was the music from Explorers of Sky and it just stung bad. So, the whole reason Im writing about this is because I was always afraid to play this game again. But I finally did it.   


My life is pretty good now, I got clean 15 months ago finally, generally am happy, but, if I was ever gonna fully move on I had to play Explorers of Sky again. I was afraid it would be really depressing but, I found myself crying in a good way, with the parts relating to Grovyle and going to the future and back especially, but most of all with the Steam Caves, and Treeshroud Forest music playing. I never cry, I hadn't since 2021 lol but yeah, this game did it. But I feel like I finally can enjoy what may be the best Pokemon game ever, certainly one of my favorite video games ever made. I feel like she was with me the whole time I was playing it and from now on I'll always be grateful to have this game to go back and feel that connection with her, even if she's not here anymore.",which title should i purchase,which title should i purchase hey pokemon players so i just wanted to share something personal relating to the pokemon games cause its been weighing heavy on me i realize there are limitations to what they really let people post on this subreddit but it would mean a lot to me if this post were allowed and i really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it i was in tears just writing this so hopefully this story touches someones heart  this is the story of me and pokemon mystery dungeon explorers of sky anyway so lets go back to summer  i was in love with a woman named jess whom id known since college and we were both big pokemon fans once we moved in together we would wake up on days that we had nothing going on which was quite often haha and play on our gbadsds with the tv in the background for hours before really getting around to doing anything it was like our daily ritual it was  of the things early on that really connected us the love of the pokemon universe so  day i tell jess im about to replay explorers of sky for the first time in a few years id only ever played through it completely twice as it wasnt that old of a game to my surprise she had never played it she did play the original on gba however so i ended up getting it on my pc to play on the tv so she could watch me play and take turns playing and enjoying the story over the next few days it was amazing to see her reaction to all the cute little things and all the great twists and turns of the plot of explorers of sky i think we played it for about  hours a day for a week straight lol all of the amazing music from the game was probably her favorite part actually and after we finished we would still listen to the music through the jukebox occasionally and go back to grind so teleport us to about  months later she went away to see her family but had to stay there due to her father having a serious health issue and i couldnt be with her for about  weeks including new years i had no idea when she was coming back so it was pretty depressing but when she was gone i did another replay of that game to pass the time and found myself really sad playing it without her the music honestly hurt to hear the next winter life was good we had got engaged on thanksgiving and  days after christmas we went to get matching tattoos at a friends house and then someone hit our car yeah she died instantly it obviously was the worst thing thats ever happened to me i was alone again on new years and all i could think about was the music from explorers of sky and it just stung bad so the whole reason im writing about this is because i was always afraid to play this game again but i finally did it my life is pretty good now i got clean  months ago finally generally am happy but if i was ever gonna fully move on i had to play explorers of sky again i was afraid it would be really depressing but i found myself crying in a good way with the parts relating to grovyle and going to the future and back especially but most of all with the steam caves and treeshroud forest music playing i never cry i hadnt since  lol but yeah this game did it but i feel like i finally can enjoy what may be the best pokemon game ever certainly one of my favorite video games ever made i feel like she was with me the whole time i was playing it and from now on ill always be grateful to have this game to go back and feel that connection with her even if shes not here anymore,5

I grown up watching the cartoon when I was a kid but in the past I’ve never had money to buy a gameboy. I’m on my 30s now. A few years ago I finished some classic games in my computer like the Pokémon Red and I enjoyed a lot. 

I recently brought a switch and enjoyed even more finishing Let’s Go Eeve. I also played Pokémon Go for a few years until 2022. 

However playing Pokémon sword in my switch didn’t exactly felt good. Seems like a enormous empty word full of not desirable/weak pokemons. Don’t get me wrong, I know most of them but it’s just seems like a completely negative experience compared with the classic games. Does anybody fell the same way?

here is my personal thoughts as well as recapping at least episode 51 to 64,digimon,"(please note I am only going to be skipping up to 52 and 55 for not really doing much other than basically be a lot more character development as well as most of the Week episodes but other than being good episodes and I do enjoy some of the concepts but didn't really feel like there's much bringing you on the table as well as more typical monster of the week)

I am making the recap  separate from the review because it was going to be a bit of a long one

&#x200B;

episode:  51 DarkKnightmon went on a rampage for his head and warping evolutions ( personally I would say it was a good episode but I don't really do much to me other than introducing warping evolutions)

(skip episode 52 to 55)

episode 56: this is where I feel like a show got interesting again. it's basically Kuzuhumon wanting to basically make the world pure again saving taking away the humans free will or something like that and also the Mega Evolution Siriusmon ( I feel likehonestly all about this design and really cool design and everything gun sword and pretty much just looking like basically he wants to be Omegamon's personal bodyguard) one Digimon

episode 57: kind of going with an ominous foreshadowing of of one Digimon but that will be for latest

episode 58: the ancientSphinxmon wants to bring back his ruler I basically turning somebody into still unblocks to build a pyramid to to bring his sarcophagus and resurrect him and also the new Mega evolution Diarbbitmon ( I would say the design does remind me a lot of sakuyamon how it basically is more of a human wearing armor that's more similar to his previous forms and fulfilling his more wanting to become a knight)

episode 59: oh yes let's rip off Jiraiya from Naruto ( yes I know Jiraiya is before Naruto and everything and as well as the inspiration for the character version but still) also hello everyone's Gulus here to do your basically you're going to straight up Kill Jiraiya but instead you survived also later adopt adopted by basically one of employees members coworkers ( included growlmon cameo)

episode 60: someone was dealing with Batman the drowned ( if you don't know it's basically a female Bruce Wayne ends up basically becoming me queen of Atlantis) basically a digimon really wants to flood the entire city also a new form Mega Evolution Amphimon (it does look a bit more like this if a big daddy ( from BioShock) in the modern day female Edition. although I see people for the kind of comparing to king gainer but I haven't seen it yet and maybe I'll give it some point in summary lightning let's go back yeah you just right okay let's make it look yeah so yeah so)

episode 61: that's going to be one of the darker episodes of the show so far ( hope the dude see some therapy as well as how to get a new girlfriend after what he just witnessed and let go of his dead lover) and also Moon=Millenniummon but he'll be important for later

episode 62: the haunted apartment building ( turns out this is supposed to be a refuge house for Digimon apparently) and also clearing up that real Hiro ( which is the only thing that tells holding Espimon for pretty much the longest period of time for being a like character. and I do feel like a moments you don't really do much during points but still helped out) also it's not that surprising that Tamer I can have more than one Digimon ( look at Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth or appmon)

episode 63: Ruli become a Big eater but it turns out she got possessed as well as many other humans by a a digimon who basically still human life energy for the young Digimon and also more Digimon is coming to the human world ( wait what-)

episode 64: for about guys later this is the first time we didn't have any narration about the holographic ghost ( then again to be fair it also kind of reuses a lot of that's how early episodes) anyways the actual episode is about humans getting possessed ( but this time by a voice calling them) and turning into fish people ( well I wouldn't say that's impossible I mean have you not listening seen heavy weather's subliminal messages) caused by digimon's equivalent to a Cthulhu I remind a lot of Cthulhu ( I really need my to Cthulhu blade at some point) although some of the main protagonists have been protected ( because obvious) by the way why didn't we just use earplugs and what about deaf people.

anyways managed to defeated and as well as steal the way by  Cythllamon and his army helping the humans.  JOSHU nice to see you again and Hiro’s dad finally comes back to the human world. ( with that other way I think the show is done for now we can finally get on with our lives and awesome moment.)

with that other way I think we're done with the show and everything else and all the Happy Endings--

\*see the power and Wi-Fi going down\*

I sure Japan already has a plan about that just in case but all seriousness the situation shows seriousness this year the steaks are really high and the end is coming

&#x200B;

  although I would say it has been quite interesting after episode 55 and I can't wait for the final three episodes ( kind of wish they did last a bit longer but okay)

Alas, Shiinotic is not a very popular Pokémon, and it's easy to see why: a lot of people find it too creepy or uncanny to like, especially compared to Morelull, most of its inspirations aren't immediately obvious, it's never been featured prominently in any of the games, and even in its first appearance it was horribly overshadowed by nearly every other new Grass- and Fairy-type Pokémon. To my knowledge, not one person has ever cared enough about this freaky mushroom-man to write a thorough analysis of its design, its relevance to the Alola region and just why it has the Fairy type... until today.

First, let's take a moment to talk about its heart-meltingly adorable pre-evolution Morelull, an empty-eyed bioluminescent mushroom whose name comes from ""morel"", a famous type of edible fungus, and ""lull"", referring to how its spores can induce sleep; hopefully you haven't been pronouncing it as ""More-lull"". While Morelull may sound innocuous, merely feeding on nutrients from tree roots and soil to sustain itself and never staying in one spot so as not to cause more harm than it needs to, it has potential to be as deadly as any Fairy Pokémon: the Japanese Sun and Moon website speaks of an incident wherein a Morelull colony's spores flew into the vents of an airplane that was flying overhead, putting those on board to sleep and nearly causing a crash!

Shiinotic is best described as ""creepy cute"": it's a taller, more humanoid mushroom with the same hollow eyes as Morelull, but the additions of a blank, off-putting smile and long, green mycelium fingers through which it drains the vitality of seemingly whomever it sees fit, making for one of the more unsettling Fairy-type Pokémon; or, it could be described as a cross between a Toad from Mario and the Landlord from Super Milk Chan. Dangerous as it may be, it's not completely cruel; the anime shows that Shiinotic can also share energy with those they take a liking to, in a similar manner to how mycorrhizal fungi transfer nutrients from the soil to their botanic symbionts. Its name can be broken down into ""shiitake"", a common edible mushroom that grows on decaying wood; ""shine"", referring to its ability to produce phosphorescent light; and ""hypnotic"", referencing the idea of putting one to sleep through hypnotism, the mind-influencing psychoactive agents found within certain mushrooms, and how certain bioluminescent animals beguile prey with their mesmerizing lights.

In most languages, Shiinotic's name pertains to mushrooms and light: in both Japanese and Korean, it is Mashade, and its French name is Lampignon, which reveals that its line also takes inspiration from night lights, lamps and lampshades. The Pokémon Company directly acknowledged this in the promotional artwork for the ""Snorlax's Yawn"" merchandise, which depicts a bedroom filled with all manner of Pokémon-themed furniture, including a Shiinotic bedside lamp situated atop an Aurorus dresser.

Before going into any more detail about what could have inspired Bowling Pin Toad's appearance, it would be wise to first explain its typing. Grass is easy: prior to the revelation that fungi don't actually photosynthesize, they spent ages being conflated with and incorrectly classified as plants. As for Fairy, fairies have been associated with nature, and therefore mushrooms, for almost as long as the idea of fairies has been a thing. Over time, this has lead some lucky 'shrooms to be bestowed with such monikers as ""dryad's saddle"" and ""fairy inkcap"", as well as Shroomish and Breloom being placed in the Fairy Egg Group. During a time when people made less distinction between medical science and magic, the potential medicinal, toxic, or hallucinogenic properties of mushrooms earned them a history of use in ""sorcery"" and shamanic rituals, a trope that still persists in popular culture to this day. In fantasy stories, they're often used as potion ingredients by wizards and witches; funny enough, Shiinotic's design can be read as a literal ""mushroom cloud"" erupting from a cauldron, though it's hard to say whether or not this was deliberate.

The mushroom most frequently depicted in fairy stories and paintings, and arguably the most recognizable fungus of all, is the poisonous and hallucinogenic ***Amanita muscaria***, the red-and-white toadstool commonly known as the fly agaric. You know the one: sometimes it's shown being used as a seat or dwelling by a fairy or gnome, other times it is but one detail in an enchanted forest filled with wonder. It has since been adopted by popular culture as *the* go-to look for a wild mushroom, starting with Renaissance paintings and working its way up through Alice in Wonderland, to The Smurfs, to Mario and Minecraft, to even Pokémon's fifth generation of games, which used it as a basis for Foongus and Amoonguss. Some have also speculated the fly agaric to have religious connotations of varying levels of plausibility, from being the Soma described in ancient Hindu texts, to even being the forbidden fruit consumed by Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.

The *Amanita* genus is best known for its poisonous species, including some of the most toxic toadstools known to man; while some are in fact safe to eat provided they are correctly identified, others contain downright deadly levels of toxins. Though Shiinotic may not be poisonous, lacking the type and only learning one Poison-type move, it shares some of the other trademarks of mushrooms in this genus, including a wide convex cap covered in patches or warts, and a volva - that's the pink, sack-like structure that forms the lower part of Shiinotic's body, a remnant of the universal veil that envelops the mushroom during its infancy.

In addition to *Amanita*, Shiinotic is based on ***Mycena*** fungi, of which 59 species are known to produce **fairy fire**. Fairy fire is one of the three names for the ethereal glow produced by chemical reactions within certain fungi on decaying wood, the others being foxfire and chimpanzee fire. In particular, Shiinotic's pink cap is reminiscent of species such as *M. rosella*, *M. pura* and *M. purpureofusca*; if we branch out to other families, an even closer match is the Pink Waxcap, *Porpolomopsis calyptriformis*. While foxfire-producing fungi mainly emit it from the mycelium, the fruitbody, or both, the slippery mycena (*Roridomyces roridus*) specifically only has bioluminescent spores. The anime shows that this isn't true of Morelull nor Shiinotic, but nevertheless their Pokédex entries mainly describe their light as being emitted from their spores; likewise, *M. pruinosoviscida* is known to emit light from both fruitbody and spores. Other *Mycena* species that may hold relevance here include *M. interrupta* and *M. nargan*, also known as the pixies' parasol and the spotted pixie cap respectively; as well as several species that go by variations of ""fairy helmet"", such as the bleeding fairy helmet (*M. haematopus*).

All of this is, of course, a perfect fit for Alola: bioluminescent fungi are most common in temperate and tropical climates, and Hawaii is known as the Rainbow State (hence Team Rainbow Rocket, the Prism Pokémon Necrozma, Minior's many colors and the bedazzling Bruxish). Hawaii is home to many species capable of producing light - mostly aquatic animals and bacteria, but also the fungus ***Armillaria nabsnona***, whose mycelium is bioluminescent. In general, *Armillaria* are better known as honey fungi, for many of their species have yellow, yellowish-brown or straight-up brown caps that match up with shiny Shiinotic's, such as *A. ostoyae*, *A. luteobubalina* and *A. mellea*.

Honey fungi are an example of a facultative parasite: they grow in the roots of living trees and eventually kill them, but they've adapted to eat both living and dead organic matter - they'll continue to feed on their host even after it perishes, regardless of whether it was actually the fungus that did it in. While Shiinotic's signature move, Strength Sap, is obviously based on how fungi ""sap"" nutrients from their environment through their mycelia, the fact that it drains opponents of their strength yet gives them nothing in return brings to mind parasitic fungi which derive all of their nutrients from their hosts, such as honey fungi. Shiinotic's default color scheme also gives it the most ""psychedelic"" vibe of all fungal Pokémon, which may not be entirely a coincidence: on top of its fly agaric inspiration, magic mushrooms - yes, the ones with hallucinogenic alkaloids - mainly occur in the tropics and subtropics, including Hawaii, where you may come across *Panaeolus bisporus* and *Panaeolus cambodginiensis*.

Yet another potential mycological reference lies in Hachijō-jima, the southernmost of Tokyo's Izu islands. From the end of World War II through the end of the 1960s, the government made efforts to promote it as the ""**Hawaii of Japan**"" to increase investment and property development. It just so happens that multiple species of *Mycena* fungus known to emit a pale green light are abdundant on this island, including *M. chlorophos*, *M. pruinosoviscida*, and *M. lux-coeli*, the last of which was long considered to be endemic to Hachijō-jima until it was found on other Japanese islands decades later.

**Part 2: Mythological Roots**

As mentioned previously, shiny Shiinotic takes its color scheme from various honey fungi, making it the second Pokémon inspired by a parasitic fungus. The first was Parasect, and these two are linked in more ways than just sharing the same base stat total and evolution level: in Pokémon Sun, the Pokémon that attacks when you collect the Tiny Mushroom for the Lush Jungle trial is a Parasect, whereas in Pokémon Moon it is a Shiinotic. In Alola, Paras can only be found during the day, while Morelull is a night-only encounter. The cherry on top is this Shiinotic Pokédex entry:

>Ultra Moon: When it starts fighting for territory with Parasect, the entire area gets completely coated in spores!

Paras only appearing during the day is accurate to real cicadas, most of which are diurnal, but what about Morelull? Well, fairies in general have long been thought to come out exclusively or more often at night, including and up to the **Menehune**, a seldom-seen race of forest-dwellers spoken of in Hawaiian mythology. Though considered fairies, Menehune have more in common with dwarves, including their short, stocky build and exceptional craftsmanship. According to legend, the Menehune reside deep within the mountain forests and caves of Hawaii, away from any human civilization; stand at about 2–3 feet tall, barely shorter than Shiinotic (3'03""); and only be active at night, during which time they would establish fantastic fish ponds, roads, houses and temples. They've been credited with building some of Hawaii's finest ancient architecture before even the first Polynesian settlers arrived there.

In contemporary Hawaii, the term ""Menehune rings"" is sometimes used to refer to **fairy rings**, perfect circles of mushrooms which can cause rings of grass around them to either grow taller or wither and darken, depending on the fungus (ironically, these necrotic zones are the exact thing Morelull does its best to avoid creating). It's certainly no coincidence that three of the fungi able to grow in fairy rings are in the *Amanita* genus, which Shiinotic is already known to draw inspiration from. Even outside of Hawaii, fairy rings lend their name to the vast folklore surrounding them. Let's take a look at some more Pokédex entries:

>Sun: Forests where Shiinotic live are treacherous to enter at night. People confused by its strange lights can never find their way home again.

>Moon: It emits flickering spores that cause drowsiness. When its prey succumb to sleep, this Pokémon feeds on them by sucking in their energy.

>Sword: Its flickering spores lure in prey and put them to sleep. Once this Pokémon has its prey snoozing, it drains their vitality with its fingertips.

>Shield: If you see a light deep in a forest at night, don't go near. Shiinotic will make you fall fast asleep.

This is bog-standard fairy behavior. Many mythological fairies such as redcaps, boggarts, dullahans, rusalki and the nuckelavee were *highly* dangerous to those they crossed paths with; others were said to be or utilize will-o'-the-wisps - known in Welsh folklore as **fairy fire** - which would entrance or bewilder travelers who saw them at night. To reiterate, Shiinotic's territory is generally *not* worth the risk of encroaching on when it's dark out, just as European folktales would often warn not to step in fairy rings.

Since science hadn't yet advanced enough to disprove it, the appearance of fairy rings was attributed to supernatural beings such as elves, witches or fairies dancing in circles, and could be a sign of either good or bad luck depending on the tradition. At worst, consequences for entering them could range from being transported to the realm of the fae, to unwillingly joining in on the nightly dances until your body gives out. Legends would often paint them as being all but impossible to escape from on one's own, and since time was said to pass differently in the otherworld, your trip to Fairyland could have equated to weeks or even years elapsed in the mortal realm, potentially resulting in a near-instant death from old age after breaking free. The only way to safely investigate a fairy ring was to run around it nine times, specifically under the full moon according to a Northumberland tradition. Other creatures said to be linked to fairy rings include dragons, giant bug-eyed toads, and even the Devil himself.

At this point, you may have remembered that fairy rings are not the only mysterious circles associated with night and the paranormal. One could say that **crop circles** are the contemporary equivalent of fairy rings, even if they aren't created naturally. In some ways, aliens are the spiritual successors to traditional fairies in today's popular culture and urban legends, sharing their unknowability, alien morals, and knack for abducting random people or livestock at night without a thought only to bring them back different, sometimes with no memory of what occurred when they were kidnapped. Fairies have enough parallels to aliens that they would fall under the infamous ""ancient astronauts"" conspiracy theory, which implies that mythological beings such as gods, angels and the fair folk themselves were in fact aliens who visited Earth long ago. Another discredited theory linking the two is the ""interdimensional hypothesis"", which says that sightings and legends of beings such as ghosts, fairies and UFOs are really cover-ups for visitors from parallel realities or dimensions.

One of the most common perpetrators of alleged alien abductions are the classic **Gray Aliens**, which Shiinotic lines up with surprisingly well. The Illuminating Pokémon shares the archetypal Grays' pitch-black eyes and short stature compared to humans; it has (hyp)notic in its name, potentially referencing the alien brainwashing trope; and its huge, dome-shaped cap could very well symbolize either an enlarged brain or a flying saucer from which an alien may descend upon Earthlings, or use a tractor beam to do the inverse. Aliens being associated with light is nothing new, either. Some of the very first UFO sightings of the 20th century described them as fiery balls of light in the sky; for somewhat more recent examples, just look at E.T.'s glowing finger, or the scene from Close Encounters of the Third Kind in which colored lights are used to communicate with the extraterrestrial mothership.

This is all too perfect for games titled Sun and Moon: not only are they literally named after celestial bodies, but they also introduced the Light Trio, the astronaut-like Dewpider, the miniature meteor Minior, the extradimensional aliens called the Ultra Beasts, and the seemingly alien NPC in Haina Desert who ""returns to space"" after being shown a Solrock/Lunatone. Moreover, Hawaii has had problems with alien (as in non-native) species for centuries, just not the extraterrestrial kind. Yungoos is based on invasive mongooses that were introduced to Hawaii to control the population of imported rats; the Ultra Beasts are extradimensional beings that are used to wildly different environments from Alola, making them too dangerous to belong there, and Shigeru Ohmori confirmed this to be what the Ultra Beasts symbolize in the first place.

Though there are a couple fungi that are invasive to Hawaii, none seem like they could have inspired Shiinotic. If its creation was influenced by any invasive fungus in particular, it would likely be *Saproamanita inopinata*, one of the two species of *Saproamanita* agaric considered to be invasive by the time Sun and Moon would have started development. *Saproamanita* are in the same family as *Amanita* and were once considered to be the same genus; some species can even grow in fairy rings. *S. inopinata* has not been observed in Hawaii, but rather New Zealand, which has also struggled with invasive species, starting with dogs and rats introduced by Polynesian settlers. This would still fit Alola because some facets of the region were in fact inspired by other Oceanian islands, most notably Komala.

Going back to mythology, there's one last legendary creature that could hold relevance to Shiinotic, and if you're a Studio Ghibli fan, you may have already guessed what it is: the **kodama**, literally meaning ""tree spirit"" in Japanese. Kodama are a kind of nature deity, said to be the animated souls of the ancient trees they inhabit; the few reported sightings of kodama describe them as faint wisps or orbs of light, or as lights with tiny humanoids inside them. The Ghibli movie Princess Mononoke has what is by leaps and bounds the most famous portrayal of kodama, depicting them with entirely white skin and black dots for eyes and mouths. Pokémon is no stranger to referencing other modern media (case in point: Lokix and Baxcalibur; even the very foundation of the franchise, Poké Balls, are an Ultraman reference) so I could totally believe that the Ghibli kodama had an influence on Shiinotic's design.

**The Verdict**

Well, that's pretty much it. In conclusion, Shiinotic is one of the most inspired, well-thought out Pokémon that Generation VII has to offer, tying together a multitude of mycological and mythological references from Europe, Hawaii and Japan alike into an original forest sprite that wouldn't feel out of place in any number of fairy stories, yet also manages to remind us of more modern analogues of the fair folk. Taking into account all these different origins, it's hard to find a Pokémon more deserving of the Fairy type than Shiinotic.

**Tl;dr:** Shiinotic's potential inspirations include lamps and lampshades; mushrooms' folkloric ties to fairies and magic; a literal ""mushroom cloud"" erupting from a witch's cauldron; various fungi of the *Amanita*, *Mycena*, *Porpolomopsis*, *Armillaria* and *Saproamanita* genera, some of which produce fairy fire; Parasect, serving as its nocturnal counterpart and rival; nocturnal Hawaiian fairies known as Menehune; fairy rings, also known as Menehune rings; the double meaning of ""fairy fire"", referring to both will-o'-the-wisps and fungal bioluminescence; Gray Aliens and UFOs; and kodama, specifically the ones from Princess Mononoke.",watching  and i like skullknightmon being gatomon cus  it acknowledges her being myotismons minion in og adventure and  is foreshadowed in a way

Man after so long digimon fusion just feels weird watching,digimon,The reason I say this is because it was unfortunately the last dub until tri and adventure(2020) but then we could have had so many more series dubbed and released in the us before then!

My take on a Digimon Fighting Game Roster based on the anime.,digimon,"I'm using the anime mostly as a basis, basically the All Star Rumble we should've had. Think of it like a three health bar. First half bar is the form they start out with, second is when they get knocked out and so forth.

Also, for the sake of recognition, every character is going to be associated with their Digimon partner for the title screen, potential story, and intro animation. So Tai and Agumon would be their intro before digivolving into Greymon, the Frontier gang would either scan like the show (for bonus, they could have the silhouettes of their ""rookie"" forms)

Welcome to this week's edition of Rebuild Tuesday, a weekly event we're doing along with our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pokemon)!

This week's Pokémon is **Electivire**!

**#466 Electivire** (Japanese エレキブル)

*Thunderbolt Pokémon*

*It pushes the tips of its two tails against the foe, then lets loose with over 20,000 volts of electricity.*

**Electivire's Base Stats:**

* **HP:75** 
* **Attack:123** 
* **Defense:67** 
* **Sp. Attack:95** 
* **Sp. Defense: 85** 
* **Speed:95** 

[**Smogon Info**](https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/pokemon/electivire/)

**Introduction:**

Hey trainers, Welcome back to Rebuild Tuesday! This week we are going to be looking at Electivire, a mon who has had a very sad, gradual fall from grace. Debuting in Diamond and Pearl this 123 attack monster was in OU; moving down a tier with each generation it now finds itself in PU. It’s mediocre speed of 95 and terrible bulk makes it highly prone to being revenge-killed.
Motor Drive allows Electivire to increase its negligible speed and provides immunity to electric moves, which it already resists. Vital Spirit means that it is immune to sleep. It is outclassed by stronger electric types such as rotom and its poor move pool leaves it walled out by many common walls such as mudsdale.
How would you change Electivire so that it can become viable despite the aforementioned weaknesses. Does terastallizing improve the viability of Electivire? How would you rebuild Electivire to be viable in either SV given DLC or SwSH where it is currently available?

**How viable do you trainers think Electivire is? Is there anything else you think it needs in order to be a good competitive Pokémon (e.g. new moves, stats, abilities or typings)? What is its most optimal set?**

Water/moisture under Vital Bracelet BE,digimon,"Hi

Today I was outside all day doing work, and I took my VB BE, and I noticed it got condensation under the plastic. I didn't get it wet in anyway, I just had it outside in the cold (then realized the manual says don't use in the cold, oops). The screen is also flickering a tiny bit in the middle if I look at it super close. Aside from that the device is working fine.

I'm worried, will it work if I put it in rice or should I take it apart and wipe out the water from the inside? 

Thanks. Here's a pic to show it

**196: Espeon**

Another Eeveelution! And I've got to say, Johto's Eeveelutions are of extremely high quality. Not that bad Eeveelutions exist, they do not, but Espeon and Umbreon as a duo feel absolutely fantastic in the way they contrast each other. They both have very similar vibes of mystical power beyond mortal comprehension, combined in a package that is both abstract yet absolutely adorable, maintaining the creative chimera like elements of Eevee's design.

Between the two of the however, Espeon is the simpler design by far with a body that can arguably be accused of falling into the Gen 1 monochromatic body problem, which while not a deal breaker for me on a Pokémon this small, does detract from it. But it's elegance is communicated instead by it's shape, two tails, and the gem on it's forehead. It's effectively what Alolan Meowth would kill to be, an actual graceful and superior feline.

Compared to the Kantonian Eeveelutions, I think Espeon ends up pretty close to Vaporeon. The latter design feels more cohesive to me, with more creative elements, but I can't shake my love of Espeon's beautiful vibes. While Vaporeon edges it out, they both stand among the best Eeveelutions in y eyes in the **A+ Tier**. 

[Fanart by the appropriately named Espeongirl360](https://preview.redd.it/17ulrb3bh7ma1.jpg?width=430&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=13712bd88d10ae03c6b6fb3b8e9e1198bfe84f43)

&#x200B;

**197: Umbreon**

In case it wasn't clear by now, I'm a huge fan of Eevee and it's evolutions. And here we arrive at my absolute favorite out of all of Eevee's evolutions, my favorite Pokemon in all of Johto (and Kanto), and my 13th favorite Pokémon prior to Gen 9. I share that last piece of trivia because man does it feel fitting that the black cat is the unlucky number. 

But Umbreon honestly feels perfect to me. I'm a huge fan of black cats with emboldened yellow eyes, and definitely a cat girl in real life. Not to say that the Eevees are cats, they're chimeras with elements of dogs and rabbits mixed in, but that only enhances the appeal. More over, Umbreon does an excellent visual balance in putting more yellow lunar symbols across it's body to break up the monotony of black fur, in a way that both looks really intimidating and aesthetically pleasing at once. 

Umbreon feels like a masterclass balancing act of preserving cuteness, power, and elegance in one simple and cohesive design, and I love it a lot. It strikes at so many trends I like in Pokémon, and I'm not surprised that it's my favorite Pokémon discussed in the series so far. Also, I don't talk about shinies much, but it's shiny is BLUE and it looks BEAUTIFUL, I love the color blue and the way it glows and contrasts with the - aaaaaaaa! ...man I recognize that yellow is objectively more symbolic but if Umbreon used the shiny palate it probably would be S Tier for me.

You might find it strange that nearly two hundred posts into the series and after all this gushing about Umbreon being my favorite so far, that I don't rank Umbreon in the S Tier yet. Sorry, that's a very exclusive club - there were only 7 S-Tier Pokémon before Gen 9. There's probably still not that many, even if that's my favorite Generation. I like to keep my list of absolute favorites very narrow. Umbreon IS, however, the very top of the **A+ Tier** so far, a position more than deserved. I love this thing!

[Espeon found on ArtStation](https://preview.redd.it/ka4vmq2aj7ma1.jpg?width=432&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5d474ab14606844c3cfb98eca675b072661765cf)

**Postscript:**

Okay side note. Y'know how Vaporeon has the reputation for furry bait...? Uh, looking up fanart for Umbreon was WAAAAAY harder than Vaporeon, there were a lot of humanoid hot Umbreons. Just a weird observation. 

Also, I'm really behind, sorry. School's been tough. I have been keeping track of where I'm supposed to be though - yesterday was intended to be Murkrow and today Slowking. I'll probably get everything caught up through Misdreavus by tomorrow, just in time for the big 200.

Digimon and computer science.,digimon,"Something that has always bothered me is that Digimon doesn't take advantage of its backstory. Some versions make an effort, such as Tamers and the fact that the D-Reaper is based on the actual first computer virus and anti-virus, for one, but mostly they just go the easy 'fantasy' route. Nothing wrong with that, but c'mon, they're DIGITAL monsters!

For comparison, a while back, pokemon collaborated with a museum in Japan where they compared their fossil pokemon with the real extinct animals they were based on. Wouldn't it be cool if Digimon did a similar thing, but with like, say, the history of computer science? Like Agumon Hakase and Terriermon Assistant walking you through the work of Charles Babbage, through the Astanaoff-Berry Computer and ENIAC (which were both referenced in the Brave Tamer WonderSwan game), the advent of home computers and the internet, etc.

If they REALLY don't want to let go of the fantasy stuff, here's a fun fact -- the inventor of modern binary code,  Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, was a major Sinophile and based the system on I Ching divination. And if you want to get into tin-foil hat territory, I Ching has a set of 64 hexagrams, and many current computers run on 64-bit operating systems. Eh? EHHHH?

Yeah, so, that's my nerdy rant. What do you guys think?",Digimon and computer science. ,digimon and computer science,digimon and computer science,4

Next Order: What things reduces lifespan?,digimon,"At what point does Tiredness reduces lifespan? It said in the game to not get the tiredness bar over half, but before it even reaches half the tiredness bubble has already appeared. Does that reduces lifespan already?

Also there seems to be no limit on how many times you can die in battle, but do they reduce lifespan? Does injury reduces lifespan?

What other care mistakes are there besides not feeding, sleeping or pooping?","Next Order: What things reduces lifespan? There's nothing inherently wrong with 3D or anything.  But the problem is, I still don't think GameFreak has properly embraced the extra dimension.  I'll start off by saying the problems that they've been having in 3D.

To begin with, there's this concept of [Uncanny Valley.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley)  Ever since Pokemon has been 3D by the mainline games, since X and Y, they've entered this, and never left it.  Here are some examples why.

* **They continue to use the 3D Models in the same manner as they have their 2D sprites in battle, and it doesn't work in 3D**:  In the 2D games, the battlefield was an abstraction.  We don't see how much actual distance there is between the battling mon, they're just attacking on circular disc stages, and our mind is able to fill in the gap of what happens between easier as a result.  When a mon uses Tackle and nudges the air on their circle, we can easily imagine them running across X distance to actually ram into the opponent.  However, in 3D space, this no longer works.  We can see exactly how much physical distance there is between the mon.  So, staying on one side of the battlefield and nudging the air here is one of the examples of the games still being in Uncanny Valley since it went 3D.
* **They haven't filled in the gaps that 3D requires to be filled in with NPCs**:  This is most apparently seen in the remakes of once 2D games, like BDSP.  Characters still behave in a very stiff, unnatural (and thus Uncanny Valley) manner in the 3D space, like walking on a grid, but not moving diagonally, so they only ever do 90 degree turns.  It's entirely possible to have diagonal and smoother movement, while still being on a grid.  Just take a look at RuneScape, or even in 2D games, Lufia:  The Ruins of Lore also has smooth movement on a grid.  Also, when it comes to cutscenes, we still have lots of things being implied to have happened, rather than being shown, which is more awkward in 3D.  For example, rival Barry bumping into the player; in the old 2D Gen 4 games, the characters are very stoic and don't budge an inch.  It was possible to have the player be nudged and shake, or even get pushed back a tile, but it's still easier to accept just a textbox ""THUD!"" in this abstraction.  However, in a 3D space, that same sort of stoic reaction to that situation once again comes across as Uncanny Valley.  The characters don't lose balance, or get knocked over, or anything, so it really does just come across as far too stiff in 3D.
* **The disconnect between characters moving their mouths, but having no voice acting**:  This is made worse when the cameras are up close to their face in the 3D games too, like Sword and Shield's intro being right up in Rose's face as he flails his arms and shouts about, but not a single peep is heard out of him.  Or how Piers is doing a whole concert at his gym, but all we hear are clothes ruffling and foot tapping sounds.  I believe even Black and White 2 had something more than this for Roxie.  With the 2D games, we never saw their mouths moving to begin with, due to how low-res the pixel art was, but even if we did, I think it'd be easier to accept this in 2D rather than 3D.
* **The colours of the characters and mon aren't as vibrant as the 2D sprites**:  This is more apparent if you directly compare the models with their 2D sprite counterparts from the older games.  Charizard is a less vibrant orange and looks washed out, Blastoise is a less vibrant blue, etc.

Now of course, this isn't to say they haven't had some good things in 3D.  Some of the new signature moves, like Cinderace's ability, do get lots of dynamism from the camera moving around and dynamic angles.  But the question ends up being, is it worth it, when everything else suffers.

Next I want to talk about an example of what Pokemon could still be if it stayed 2D.

My thought is, it could've gone higher resolution with the pixel art, and given us more detailed sprites and worlds.  The DS era saw them hybridizing 2D and 3D, with the characters being 2D sprites, and the environments being 3D.   I think that could've kept going, but the pixel art would've needed to go higher resolution, to match the smoothness of the polygons at higher resolutions.  There's an artist on DeviantArt named [SassySnivy](https://www.deviantart.com/speedxaaa), who sometimes does higher-res remakes of the old 2D Pokemon sprites, and it looks gorgeous!  I think it's an example of how Pokemon could've looked, if it stayed 2D Pixel art.  Here are some examples of their work below!

They've even shown it looks nice with the old 8-bit sprites \^\^

Need info on talking Culumon,digimon,"I purchased a used ""Oshaberi Culumon"" plush toy. He talks when you press one of his 3 buttons and you talk to him. He clearly responds to certain key phrases, but I have neither box nor guide. I did find a picture of the back of the box, where I got to learn how to ask him to go to sleep, wake up and start a melody game, where I think you need to guess what song he is trying to sing, but he only gives you 3 notes, so I dunno.
I have notices that when I press his belly and just throw random words at him, he will either answer: ""ohanashi shiyo"", ""uranai suki"" and ""nanatsuki"". At least I think that's what he says, and he repeats the sentence as if he wants an answer. I have also noticed that when he does say these sentences, I can press the buttons on his feet to make him say something else, but I don't understand it.
It's really hard to find any info on this toy, so I was wondering if anyone else out there had one and could potentially share some info?

No launch bonus DLC for Nintendo switch?,digimon,How do I get or where do I find my dlc codes for pre ordering the physical game through bandai ? I got the beanie in the mail with the game but no paper no code no download for the evo stones and extra items ? And yes I have tried the presents option in the dimension box but nothing,"No launch bonus DLC for Nintendo switch? After a disappointing direct, I tried to collect all of the few informations available about the upcoming DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, so I formulated two theories about its narrative contents.

**The Teal Mask**. In the first part of the DLC, we're going to visit Kitakami and we're going meet new characters and Pokémon. Despite many people think otherwise, this first part of the DLC is strongly connected to the second one and the whole story: the new Pokémon Ogerpon is affected by Terastal even though it lives really far from Paldea. Then, there are two new important characters we're going to bring with us: Carmine and Kieran. 
Carmine is a little bit selfish, determined and hostile to people of other ethnic groups, like us. In spite of this, she has a soft spot for her little brother Kieran, who is shy and gentle.  
The three new Legendary Pokémon Okidogi, Munkidogi and Fezandipiti that protect the country from fiends and vicious beasts are based on the fairytale which inspired Tajiri for the creation of the three starters: Momotaro. 
Momotaro was a boy that was born from a peach that was found by an old lady. When he was old enough, but still a child, he gone on a battle against demons (Oni). He met three companions: a dog, a monkey and a feazant. 
Even in the trailer, we see a child with the Legendary Pokémon chasing off the fearsome Ogerpon. 
In nearly all cultures, the child is a symbol of youth, hope and humbleness. In many folklore fairytales (like Momotaro) the child that battles against monsters is seen as a growth opportunity. 
In ancient Arcadia, a Greek region, at the end of spring, sheperds thought to protect their flocks with newborn lambs from wolves' attacks by sending away someone who eaten the entrails of a sacrificed child away. We don't know if, for example, the child's blood was used to sprinkle the sheep and the lambs' barn so that wolves knew that there were humans (whom they fear) nearby, but the sense stays the same: sacrificing something,  someone important to *protect* one's resources. 
In Mesoamerican cultures, young victims of sacrifices were divinized.
If the hero of this Pokémon Momotaro was just Kievan?  In that case, he will step up with our help to fight against the malevolent presence of Ogerpon, the Pokémon buffed by Terastal. Thanks to him, Carmen will open to us.
 

**The Indigo Disk**. In the second part of the DLC, Arven, Nemona and Penny are probably going to return: you need to finish the main story to play it. You are going to study in Blueberry Academia, which bears a significant resemblance to Atlantis. Atlantis is the codename of Area Zero. Terapagos also is similar to this structure. In the form that they shown to us, Terapagos's silhouette looks like Paldea. The leaker Riddler Khu shown a picture of the movie King of Thorn. 
It is about humanity struggling against a virus which turns bodies to stone. Later on, it's discovered that this virus never existed, but a creature that fell from a meteor in Siberia called Medusa, who can make wishes come true, generated it. The whole DLC's codegame is ""Sudochi"". It isn't the fruit, but an asteroid. It seems that in this DLC we're going to uncover the true nature of Paldea's geological history. It looks like it's inspired also by the most ancient version of the World Turtle's myth, in which the turtle was the world. Will we face Terapagos in its true colors? Why has it got this form?

When I was playing Scarlet, I picked up a Gibble fairly early on, and was able to fully evolve it into Garchomp before the end of the game, and thinking about it, it was the first time I was actually able to incorporate a pseduo into my team just playing normally.

Looking into it, I don't think there's many that you actually could use in a game , Even with the others you can obtain early  on in S/V, like Deino and Dreepy, they don't evolve to lvl 50, so you'll be weighed down by them a lot till just before the end game.

Granted, they do become very powerful at the final stage, but its a bit inconsistant how Beldum and Gibble evolve at lvl 20 and 24 respectively, the avergae seems to be 30, but then Dreep and Deino evolve at 50.

It seems the only viable options that don't hinder you for most the game are Garchomp and Metagross, since you could get gibble/gabite fairly early in S/M+ S/V and Beldum in S/M.

I just put them to lvl 100, gave them full protein and bottle caps ; and they're all good, like really I didn't do anything crazier than that.

Or you can be the support guy with an Umbreon or a Blissey build, it is incredibly useful for everyone. Also don't forget to (always) use cheers.  
Depending who you're fighting, I'll also advise to put aside Greninja, Cinderace, Azumarill,  Meowscarada etc.. because they're not defensive enough.

PS : if you're scarlet and want an Iron hands, mp me I'll give you one with pleasure. I'll be available to trade in \~5 hours.

Yes, I know this is out of order. No, I don't care because Ting-Lu is my favorite and I will die on this hill.

First up, etymology. Ting-Lu's name is very straightforward, being the Wade-Giles romanization of its Chinese name, 鼎鹿. 鼎 refers to the cauldron on its head, while 鹿 means deer.

Out of the two, the more interesting one is the Cauldron. In ancient China, these cauldrons were originally used for cooking, but later developed into religious vessels of sacrifice and then eventually symbols of imperial authority. The green-ish color indicates that it is likely made up bronze, as most cauldrons were, though interestingly it has a round bottom and 3 legs, as opposed to a square bottom and 4 legs that were used by those of higher authority. One possible explanation is that the cauldron was made very early on, before the invention of the 4-legged cauldrons, when cauldrons were made almost exclusively by nobles and for them to show their power. The age of the cauldron is fitting, as Ting-Lu is the accumulated fear of people over thousands of years, which I will go over later.

Regarding their symbolism, Legend goes that an ancient king once ordered to make 9 massive cauldrons for 9 of its regions to celebrate the kingdom's wealth and engrave the kingdom's wisdom on it for future generations. They were so large that it took millions of people months to move them to the capital city once they were built. Over the years, as kingdoms were overthrown and capitals moved from place to place, the new kings would move the cauldrons with them, symbolizing the seize of political power. A person asking about the quality of the cauldrons were a direct indication that they would want to seize power. All 9 cauldrons were eventually lost.

Now that we understand the cauldron, why deer? My favorite answer is that this is a massive reference to the book *The Deer and the Cauldron* by Jin Yong (Louis Cha). Jin Yong was one of the most influential  writers in Chinese history who wrote almost exclusively in the Wuxia genre, which is mixture between historical fiction, fantasy, drama, and lots of martial arts. His books are characterized by rich references to traditional Chinese culture and values, combining factual history with mystical powers that roughly follow Chinese philosophy. *The Deer and the Cauldron* is his last Wuxia novel, and is the most unique of them all; instead of a traditional hero, the protagonist is a lazy and rebellious anti-hero with no knowledge of martial arts, akin to the Dark type in Pokemon. During his journey, he made friends with the “Heaven and Earth society”, a secret society aiming to overthrow the Qing dynasty and became their spy in the palace. Through wit, deception, and sheer luck, he became a powerful figure in the government known as the “Duke of Deer Cauldron”, assisting both the emperor and his underground friends. However, the emperor eventually found out about his falsity, and forced him to either remain loyal to the palace and kill the society, or be exiled and outcast forever. He chose the latter, bringing his entire wealth and 7 wives to a remote land in the South, never to be found again.

How does this relate to Ting-Lu? In the story, the cauldron symbolizes a king’s desire to seize absolute authority, while the deer symbolizes the common people helplessness to fight back. Together, they represent the struggles of Chinese (Han) people against the Manchu-led Qing dynasty. This coincides with how the cauldron in Ting-Lu is broken: the ancient Chinese rituals are replaced with foreign ones, breaking the traditional norms. It also explains the dex entries. In Scarlet, Ting-Lu is revealed to be the embodiment of fear, alluding to how Ancient Chinese history is one of many dynasties, each one ending violently either by a tyrant or an invader, each time bringing along great chaos that causes mass fear and panic. For Violet, Ting-Lu bringing its head to the ground can be seen as a metaphor for a dynasty crumbling, splitting the country into dozens of fragments just as how Ting-Lu splits the earth. Ting-Lu is the embodiment of the common people's fear of the upper-class authority of the government.

Finally, let's take a look at how the rest of this Pokemon supports my theory. Ting-Lu's ability, Vessel of Ruin, lowers special attack, just as how the iron grip of a strong authority restricts minds and willpower. The Dark type is self-evident, while the Ground type likely refers to land and the importance of land in political control. In Ancient Chinese philosophy, people reside on the ground and the gods reside in heaven (literally 'sky'). Control over land is direct control over political power, especially since Ancient China was very much an agricultural society, where people lived in farms and rarely moved beyond. Land is the people's home, and thus changes in Land, either politically or physically, results in massive fear of the unknown future as people could no longer sustain themselves with what was passed on by their elders. The emphasis on 'homeland' is a large part of Chinese values, as is patriotism. Another interpretation is that Ground is ancient and steady, like the rule of a powerful authority. This can be seen on Ting-Lu's body, where clear layers can be seen like those of mountains or sedimentary rock, even building up a mountain at the top. These layers can only be formed over long periods of time, where different climates creates different layers that build up on top of one another. Ting-Lu's chin also has what looks like to be stalactites, which can also only be formed over long periods of time. 

TL;DR: Ting-Lu references a famous novel of the Wuxia genre, where the cauldron and the deer symbolize the greed for power and the commoners' fear and helplessness in face of violence and chaos caused by those with authority.",im high on copium,im high on copium this will likely be the first of  posts each detailing the origins of each member of the treasure of ruins yes i know this is out of order

As for the nerf suggestion: Tatsugiri is just too strong in its Dondozo combo, despite having counters. For starters, the Commander ability should increase Dondozo’s stats by only 1 stage each, and those same stats should decrease when Tatsugiri faints while inside Dondozo.

Do you want a Ghost Game sequel?,digimon,"Ghost Game is officially ending VERY soon. Obviously, there are still quite a few plots that need to be finished in a very short amount of time. So a lot of people are assuming there will be a sequel...

Do you want a Ghost Game sequel?

Personally, I *do* want a Ghost Game sequel because Hiro, Ruli, Kiyo, and everyone else deserves to really be explored much more than they were explored in Ghost Game. Characters like Espimon, Ryudamon, and most of the Digimon and human side characters deserve way more screentime and development than they were given. They're very charming, but they're also really flat as they are now. They were all set up fairly well, but there's no way there can be any follow through with how little time is left. GulusGammamon especially deserves a *year's worth* of screentime, but he's presumably only going to get around 6 or 7 episodes of time.

At the same time though, I feel like Ghost Game doesn't *deserve* a sequel and hasn't set itself up for a sequel. It had more than enough time to finish the stories it set up (Where's Weedmon, Piedmon, Phelesmon, and why was Dracmon killed off so stupidly?). It had more than enough time to explore the characters and let them develop. It had more than enough time to lay out and solve all the mysteries it has, but its pacing was way too messy to give anyone the time they deserved. I don't know if the writers were screwed over by Toei or something, or if they were just too ambitious, but I feel like Ghost Game could have comfortably been finished in 50 episodes with much better pacing and focus. 

If there really is a sequel, it will probably take a long time to actually come out, and they would probably have to add in a bunch of new crap to make it worth being a show (though I guess they could do something like a 6-part series like Tri). They could make a movie instead, but that's not a good idea when it's taken them over a millennium to tell us that the 02 movie does indeed *exist.* A Ghost Game movie would probably come out at the same time as a real life Gammamon hologram.

I want a sequel, but it's really frustrating that a sequel can even be considered for a show that could have ended neatly. Then again, most Digimon shows have really rushed endings so...At least Ghost Game's not the first show to mess up its climax (Runaway Locomon, I'm looking at you)...Or maybe I'm wrong and the next couple of episodes will be the greatest conclusion to anything ever.

Recently Wrapped Up My PS1 Collection,digimon,,"Recently Wrapped Up My PS1 Collection I've been playing Pokémon since the first gen, obviously, I was very young when I started so naturally, I have some nostalgic feelings for the older games, especially gen 3/4.

Now, I started playing Pokémon Heartgold again to have a savestate I could shiny hunt on. 50h in and I'm at the Indigo Plateau, and I'm struggling hard.

I've already caught Ho-Oh and if not for it, I wouldn't get past the first Trainer. You are incredibly underleveled if you don't grind before every single gym, ESPECIALLY if you switch pokémon here and there, because apparently Pokémon you catch in the Wild have to be 10lvl under the Trainer average. So either keep the same team from the start or have fun grinding.

You see my main complaint with this game yet? It's not that it's hard, it's just boring. I'm gonna have to continue putting time into grinding my pokémon up to Level 50 just for me to make it through the Elite 4. There's no skill involved in grinding. IDK why people constantly bring up old games like they weren't incredibly flawed too?

My current team consists of:

Dratini Lvl 25

Sure, the Difficulty in modern Pokémon games feels lacking, but isn't that because we all know all they types and weaknesses now? I can absolutely see why GameFreak / Pokémon doesn't listen to their fans that much, because we are absolutely biased towards the arguably worst games of the series.

Vital Bracelet BE question(s),digimon,"I have two Omnimon Zwarts on my Digivice V from the Mad Black Roar and Mad Shadow Howl cards, but I have a Vital Bracelet BE ordered.

1.) Is there any way to move them from the Digivice V to the BE? If I go into the app, say I'm using the BE, and try to upload them, will it just not work? Same goes if I'm in the Digivice V portion and I tap it with the BE, will that not work either?

2.) If that's impossible, will my work clearing Stage 15 on my particular Dim cards be recognized by the BE — i.e., if I cleared Stage 15 with those cards on the Digivice V, could I get to Omnimon Zwart with the first egg I hatch from those Dim cards on the BE? That would certainly make reraising them go faster.

Thanks in advance!","Vital Bracelet BE question(s) Something that I want to discuss in PLA's anniversery a while back. The title is pretty self explanatory: What other potential ancestors would you guys like to see in another Legends game?

One ancestor I would like to see is one for [Viola](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Viola). Perhaps they love to draw or take pictures (depending on how long ago the game would take place) of various Pokemon they had spotted - And could even give the player a photo of a rare Pokemon.

[Koga](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Koga) is another charater I want to see a potential ancestor of, given that Beni mentioned the ancient ways on the ninja. It would be nice to see another ninja character in the past who has more connections to a contemporary ninja character.

A character based on [Silver](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Silver_(game)) would also be interesting, though their teams would not take inspiration from Silver's. Instead I imagine such a character using mainly Ground types, like Dugtrio and Rhydon, as a callback to Giovanni, and highlight his relation to Silver. They might even be seen starting what would later become Team Rocket.

I would also like to see a [Cara Liss](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Cara_Liss) ancestor in the less distant past, where they recently invented fossil resurrection. Unfortunately, they would have a *lot* of misunderstandings on their craft, resulting in previous fossil Pokemon gaining... less than ideal new forms (by anatomical standards).

My final idea for a Legends character isn't an ancestor, but I still want to include her here: I want to see [Liza](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Tate_and_Liza) get the Ingo treatment and be sent back to the past with no memories. (After all, the distortions separated one set of twins, so why not another >:)) I like to imagine that version of Liza being discovered by some friendly bamboo harvesters one night, who then take her in as their own. She would also end up in a position of high power - not exactly a princess, more like one of PLA's Wardens.

But what about you guys? What other characters would you like to see in another Legends title?",vital bracelet be questions,vital bracelet be questions something that i want to discuss in plas anniversery a while back the title is pretty self explanatory what other potential ancestors would you guys like to see in another legends game one ancestor i would like to see is one for violahttpsbulbapediabulbagardennetwikiviola perhaps they love to draw or take pictures depending on how long ago the game would take place of various pokemon they had spotted  and could even give the player a photo of a rare pokemon kogahttpsbulbapediabulbagardennetwikikoga is another charater i want to see a potential ancestor of given that beni mentioned the ancient ways on the ninja it would be nice to see another ninja character in the past who has more connections to a contemporary ninja character a character based on silverhttpsbulbapediabulbagardennetwikisilver_game would also be interesting though their teams would not take inspiration from silvers instead i imagine such a character using mainly ground types like dugtrio and rhydon as a callback to giovanni and highlight his relation to silver they might even be seen starting what would later become team rocket i would also like to see a cara lisshttpsbulbapediabulbagardennetwikicara_liss ancestor in the less distant past where they recently invented fossil resurrection unfortunately they would have a lot of misunderstandings on their craft resulting in previous fossil pokemon gaining less than ideal new forms by anatomical standards my final idea for a legends character isnt an ancestor but i still want to include her here i want to see lizahttpsbulbapediabulbagardennetwikitate_and_liza get the ingo treatment and be sent back to the past with no memories after all the distortions separated one set of twins so why not another  i like to imagine that version of liza being discovered by some friendly bamboo harvesters one night who then take her in as their own she would also end up in a position of high power  not exactly a princess more like one of plas wardens and she would be seen outside on nights with a cresent moon shedding tears as if she was reminiscing an forgotten friend from long ago but what about you guys what other characters would you like to see in another legends title,4

Feebas [Digimon] Baby form 🐟💙,digimon,,"Feebas [Digimon] Baby form 🐟💙 As a player who is disappointed with SV but really enjoyed PLA, I think a modern Pokemon game's single player would be stronger if it emphasized side quests that help expand the game's world. Not that BOTW doesn't do that, but when we hear BOTW the assumption is ""wide open sandbox, non-linear progression."" 

The Yakuza series is famous for its involved side quests, both for comedic purposes but also delivering some pretty impactful side stories as well. I was thinking of PLA and getting side quests that featured Pokemon and humans being brought together, and that helping establish the modern-day relationships of Pokemon and people. Little side stories would really go a long way to add content to these empty cities/towns, and help flesh out the people of the region.

I'll probably get blasted by the SV community, but I just feel like these games failed ""BOTW Pokemon"" experience people expected, playing in this big empty sandbox without the tools and toys of a Zelda game. Hyrule is a setting 100 years after a near apocalyptic event, yet it feels more alive than Paldea.

Magnamon (Blue) Custom Figure,digimon,"I bought two standard Magnamon Figure-rise Figures. One to display as regular Magnamon and the other to show Magnamon if he was a standard mega digivolution much like Rapidmon’s ultimate form (green). I decided to put him in Blue armor instead of gold. 

I know many people have probably recolored Magnamon to look like a standard level version of himself instead of an armored digimon (personally I think Magnamon would be a mega level digimon instead of an Ultimate like rapidmon green) 

Anywho. I hope you guys like what I did. It's extremely rough, but this is my first repaint of a model of this scale. I really liked how he came out though

"" Thought to be an embodiment of the sun, it appeared during a bitterly cold winter and saved Pokémon from freezing.""

 Not only does drought fit his lore I think it fits his gameplay. Volcarona is so close to be good but he needs that something to make him better. Also we need more options for sunlight setup Pokémon. Not to mention is weakness to stealth rocks would make it hard for you to just swithch into him whenever you want to get sunlight up.

Does anybody know anything about this Growmon toy?,digimon,,"Does anybody know anything about this Growmon toy? First i’ll say this : yes Hoenn was my first gen with Emerald.

But i played every game / gen to this day with Scarlet/Violet and if we are honest, 3rd gen really is the best of pokemon 

- Only gen where we have 2 distincts team fighting and both are included in the other game (Team Magma is in Saphire or AS for exemple)
- One of the best trio starter
- Best post game content in the days and even with the ORAS remake (Delta episode)
- Secret Bases
- Pokemon Contest
- The Regi-trio is by far the best trio within all game (i’m waiting on S/V to see maybe)

And with gen 6 we got Soaring with Latios/Latias and megas? The only thing that Hoenn is missing is character customization like in X/Y

I like the other game as well don’t get me wrong but even if i take i step back, i feel 3rd gen is the best fully complete of them all

Usually I don’t start fight training till my Digimon have got a little staggered and my Ultimate/mega can carry the rookie though the fights that give good stat bonuses.

"next order releases tomorrow, so why is steam still saying ""coming soon"" ??",digimon,,"next order releases tomorrow, so why is steam still saying ""coming soon"" ?? I live in the suburbs and don't have a car. So I take my dog and we walk around the apartment complexes around ours. 

I picked up PoGo in December to help me walk more. Since I was starting from nothing, I've been slowly building endurance and walking more and more. 

I take breaks and sit at picnic tables or benches around the neighborhoods so I can rest, catch mon, and then go on to walk the next leg of my journey. 

Last night I was sitting on a bench outside the leasing office of an apt complex I frequent (two stops at the entrance and higher than the normal mon spawns) and two cops showed up. They said someone complained and they were checking if I'm ok. I told them what I was doing and asked if I'm not supposed to be there and they just kinda rolled their eyes and said we just came to see if you're ok bc someone called. 

Since they didn't seem to care, I thought it was fine. Well I had a cig and went to leave when more people showed up. I saw two old people talking to the cops, so clearly the ones that complained, and then a leasing office person showed up too. I was leaving so they all followed me and she was like ""you can't be there, you're scaring the residents, it's private property"" so I said ok and left. 

It's fine. It sucks but the neighborhood next to it also has a bench and there's a gym at that entrance, so whatever. But it's been bothering me since. I feel like I did something wrong and I just feel shitty. 

Why are people so annoying? I walk by with my golden, sit on a bench outside, and then leave. I don't bother anyone. What is scary about a 40+ overweight lady with a golden catching pokemon?

Digimon OCs and Their Canon Counterparts. Goin' Together Like Oil and Water.,digimon,"So not too long ago I was asking around about fanfiction - and if that ain't your thing, tag out now - and was specifically asking about things that are either original from the ground up, versus those that are based on anime or other worlds from the games and such. And one question I had was particularly when it comes to OCs in relation to canon characters.

OCs are sort of the most divisive things in fanfiction. People either vehemently hate them, or they can respect them. Mainly because OCs are the simplest thing to get wrong and the hardest thing to get right - especially when it comes to protagonist characters. Even more controversial, is when those characters are shipped with canon characters as well.

I bring this up because I had the idea of doing a fic that had an OC protagonist character, but touched upon or involved different characters from the franchise, especially due to the recent anniversary. However, I understand that many people wouldn't wanna read a fic about some newbie they'd never heard of, and would want to see the characters they're already familiar with. Conversely, however, one could argue that those official characters obviously exist in their original works, so why not see newer characters as opposed to those older ones, when you could just go back to watch the original product to see those older characters?

It really is a balancing act, if that weren't clear enough. Hence, I felt the need to just reach out to check some general pet peeves, easy ways to avoid issues, things of that accord based on your own experiences, either from good examples, or things that were so bad you wonder how the author couldn't have caught the obvious problems.

1. Adventure 02 isn't as bad as people say it is. It connects to Adventure's continuing so that's all I care about. 

2. Savers is garbage and started the downfall of the Anime Series. Literally the only thing that I like about the show is Gaomon and his evolutions as I find the designs cute.

"So, the newest episode had me thinking…",digimon,"How high are the chances that all the happenings are Hokuto’s fault? It’s no coincidence that he pops up and all of a sudden the Digital World disappears. I have two theories, maybe a third. 

One: Hokuto’s an incompetent scientist meddling with things he should not be, giving out free, one-way tickets to the real world for who knows what reason. 

Two: Everything that has happened has all lead up to this point, as planned by Hokuto, with Gammamon growing enough to have reached his Mega-level stage consistently, and he’s planning to do something incomprehensible with Gulusgammamon/Regulusmon/Arcturusmon. 

Three: Being in the Digital World for so long, Hokuto could have either fallen to corruption by some deeply evil Digimon or teamed up with said Digimon for scientific purposes. 

Alas, I doubt it’d be any of the three, with how surprising the reveal of the Digital World disappearing is, the writers got something juicy planned.","So, the newest episode had me thinking… ",so the newest episode had me thinking,so the newest episode had me thinking,7

just how tolerable is the plates mechanic in Lost Evolution?,digimon,"I got really excited about lost evolution finally being translated, but I've heard a lot about this lame mechanic where you need to clean plates to evolve your digimon. And things like this seem like they'd be very difficult to do on an emulator without a stylus. 

So I just wanted to ask, hoe tolerable is it? Is it something that breaks the experience? 

But I also want to play with Examon really bad lol, and he isn't in the two previous games.","just how tolerable is the plates mechanic in Lost Evolution? [https://imgur.com/a/TXlOLUA](https://imgur.com/a/TXlOLUA)

So I don't know how other players have found the game recently, but for me it's been insanely disappointing. Each event seems worse and worse, and every update Niantic pushes out just seems to add more bugs or performance issues that never get addressed. To top it off, tomorrow is Elite raid day...

&#x200B;

I reluctantly plan to be out for it. Despite how poor the game has felt lately, and despite how I hate what these elite raids stand for: a raid that blocks a gym for 24 hours, which you have to take part in in-person and requires coordinating with other players without the ability to remote invite from afar. Something pretty much impossible for a small (almost non-existant) community like mine. I've tried using Campfire to arrange raids in the past, but because it's still closed off to the majority of players, nobody where I live (in the middle of nowhere) seems to bother using it. It also lags my phone out, so instead, despite the fact I have Elite raids spawned fairly close by, I have to coordinate with friends through Discord and travel 10 miles away to have **any** hope of taking part. Even then, I don't know if we'll have enough players, since there's only 3 or 4 others who I know are definitely taking part.

&#x200B;

I don't mind the travelling part really; probably since I'm used to all the extra travelling and subsequent expense this game causes by now, and honestly it is at least a little better this time since they properly advertised the elite raid day. Afterall, I heard absolutelty nothing about the last elite raid day until I saw the raid eggs pop up. But after the Hoenn tour... I just feel less and less motivation to play this game. Not to rant about that too much, but 2 shinies is what I managed - this was after travelling **even further afield** (20ish miles?) to a town that has a much higher spawn density and number of players. I played for the full 8 hours the first day, caught god knows how many Pokemon with my Pokeball plus, hatched a bunch of eggs, and did a bigger bunch of raids. I even kept an eye on the ""journal"" log to see whether any shinies fled whilst being caught on auto with the Pokeball Plus... nothing. Just the one Pokemon I got from a research task (a pokemon I'd already had shiny), and the kinda cool, kinda dissappointing wild shiny Latias... which I also already had one of. None of the new shinies. None of the regional egg ones. Not the much vaunted shiny Groudon I really wanted, or another shiny Kyogre (I got very lucky with a trade a few years back at least). Not even any of the decent shinies I already had, but was still hunting like crazy.

&#x200B;

Honestly, I've never had good luck with the tour days. Hell, both previous tours I either broke my phone, or had catastrophic tech problems - feel like the tour events are a curse for me at this point. But this time I seriously went all out... and that's all I get? I spent money on the Jirachi questline thinking I'd at least get 2 extra incenses for the weekend (since they did list that as a bonus), only to be stung because I forgot they love to make the tour questlines absurdly long and tedious, and literally impossible to finish quickly. I'm hardly surprised that for the third Tour event in a row I completely failed to get a shiny Unown, something I've been hunting since the beginning... and yet they make it a requirement for the dex completion to get every Unown as a shiny?! Then let's not forget how they didn't put out any real info until the last minute, generously made the event ""free""... but then took away the 8 bonus raid passes that usually come with the event, to force players to buy premiums or remote passes in the shop. I honestly feel the only reason they made it free was so they had the excuse to lower shiny rates etc., since ""it's free, so people can't complain"". And let's also not forget how bad the Las Vegas players had it, because the location locked ticketed events always seem to be a catastrophe (plus didn't the game ticket cost like $70 with all the added extras, before even having to buy plane tickets & accommodation?!).

&#x200B;

...And with regards to this latest update notification, is all of that supposed to be part of their ""renewed commitment to bolstering Pokemon Go's in-person experience""? Because from what I can see, they've just been making the game worse, regardless of whether you play in-person or from home. I mean for crying out loud, if you want players to play and raid in person, for one thing **actually give more XL rare candies from doing raids in person**. That was meant to be a thing for a while now, but in-person raids still **almost never** drop them.

&#x200B;

Honestly, I'm just... so done with this company, and this game right now. I've had problems with Niantic for years... and I mean of course I have, since I'm a rural player. It felt like things might finally improve a bit when they added the Coronavirus concessions, because they actually made the game more accessible. But they just seem intent on stripping all of that back and then some. And that's precisely why this update message worries me.

&#x200B;

Before this elite Raid day event, I practically stopped playing for 2 full weeks. And you know what? I actually had fun, because I wasn't playing this game. I still play occassionally because it's a weak excuse to get exercise and meet up with friends, but honestly... even if tomorrow goes well, I'm honestly considering just quitting altogether.

&#x200B;

As a last note, if you're feeling the same way... here's something I feel is pretty relevant: [https://imgur.com/gallery/a1sxiIT](https://imgur.com/gallery/a1sxiIT)

concept for a new anime season,digimon,"Realistically I don't see this as happening as its own season but maybe a mini series or something. 

I think it would be fun to see an anthology series retelling various mythology but using digimon's version of the characters. There could be an episode about the Olympos 12, one about Egyptian mythology, and maybe one about the sovereigns.

Back to Greek mythology I think an episode based on the recent Achillesmon. I could also see something about Hercules/Herakles either as a new Digimon or as a human character with his own partner Digimon, he would then fight Digimon like Hydramon and Cerberumon.",concept for a new anime season ,concept for a new anime season,concept for a new anime season,6

[Vital Bracelet] Battle Success rate and Transferring DiMs,digimon,"I had a couple of questions about the Vital Bracelet if anyone might know the answers, sorry if this is a little long.

At the moment I'm using the Impulse City DiM and have raised Kazuchimon with max Vital Values and have been working through the Adventure missions, but 3 or 4 times in a row I've failed at Stage 13 against Shivamon, while pretty much every other battle I do results in a win. I was wondering if a Digimon's attribute contributes to their success rate, as Kazuchimon is a Vaccine and Shivamon is Data, which would put me at a disadvantage. If this the case, would it make sense to store Kazuchimon away for now and raise Achillesmon for the advantage? I plan to raise all 4 Megas so I would eventually be doing this anyway. Also, if I store my current Digimon, does this reset the Adventure mission progress? In which case, I'd be better off just continuing as is and hoping to get lucky next time.

My 2nd question concerns the Vital Bracelet BE. I'm currently using the vanilla VB and Impulse City is my first DiM, but it was recently announced that the BE is getting an official release here in the UK, so I'm tempted to upgrade when it's released, as I don't want to miss out on some of the BE exclusive DiMs that have been announced going forward. I believe that the BE has no limit on using DiM cards on multiple devices, but does this apply to DiMs already registered on a non-BE Bracelet? I can take the loss of Impulse City if so, but wouldn't want to register any other DiMs on this device before getting a BE in that case.",[Vital Bracelet] Battle Success rate and Transferring DiMs ,vital bracelet battle success rate and transferring dims,vital bracelet battle success rate and transferring dims,8

dubbed tamers thoughts spoilers,digimon,"just finished tamers and what a ride.

starting it was fun but felt like standard digimon. I enjoyed rikas development she wears a broken heart t-shirt for most of the show then wears a heart t-shirt showing how she is complete nice touch.

odd how guilmon ultimate and mega and same with terriermon had  bad looking cgi animation but renamon still had nice 2d animation for digivolving. I liked the music for biomerging 

the movie island of Adventurers was ok felt like an extended episode nothing special.

i enjoyed the deva arc and leomon 😔 draper jeri was freaky.

in the dub she said her mum died and she treated her stepmother badly is it same in sub ? 

they made jeris dad a douche due to him leaving jeri and not helping her when she retired from the digital world is he like that in sub.

i liked the meta that digimon 01 and 02 are TV shows in the tamer world.

i also enjoyed impmons arc even if he was forgiven quiet fast. but he had a cool remdeption.

i like the idea that jangu gang created the digimon but then revealed they were already there but the monster makers helped the digimon expand which further triggered the d reaper.

when kai appeared he sounded like Davis then in next scene had a surfer dude accent lol.

the ending was emotional but the reveal of the portal and the TV movie does kinda take away a bit from the emtional ending as we know they will see each other again granted if you didn't know about the TV movie it could be an ambiguous ending. 

but Henry not forgiving his dad 😔.

not sure why marineangemon didn't dedigivolve from mega. 

overall I really enjoyed the whole show even in dub. 

the locomon movie was good but took away a bit from the ending of the show as I mentioned. especially as the digimon were already in the real world with no explationantion. unless this movie takes place after d reapers defeat but before they all go back to the digital world ?

kinda like last evolution kizuna emtional ending is undone due to the release of 02 the beginnings.","dubbed tamers thoughts spoilers For the levels that require x platinum medals, do catch medals that are platinum count toward that number?",dubbed tamers thoughts spoilers,dubbed tamers thoughts spoilers for the levels that require x platinum medals do catch medals that are platinum count toward that number,4

Restoring an old Digivice D3 toy.,digimon,"So I recently managed to get one of the old Digivice D3 toys from the 2000's and as expected from electronic toys this old, sometimes it just doesn't work properly and I think some people here with the same toy can recognize some of the symptoms.

What if Tai had a Betamon instead?,digimon,"Agumon is pretty much the main mascot of the franchise, and I believe this is due to 2 factors: Agumon being a Rookie in the very first V-Pet and due to this, being chosen as Tai's partner Digimon in the Adventure anime. This not only catapulted Agumon into being the face of the Digimon franchise but also started the trend of dinosaur and dragon Digimon being associated with the main heroes of each series (fan-favourite Guilmon in particular is stated to be inspired in-universe by Agumon).

But the V-Pet had another choice of Rookie; Betamon. So I'm curious, what if they gave Tai a Betamon instead? What impact would this have had on the series? Would it have affected the choice of the other Chosen Children's partners? What would its line have been? What other changes to the anime would have happened? And how would it affect the franchise as a whole? Would sea serpents become the primary ""main character"" Digimon instead of dinosaurs? Would Guilmon end up a completely different Digimon? What other outcomes would this one change have caused?

These are the questions that keep me up at night.",What if Tai had a Betamon instead? ,what if tai had a betamon instead,what if tai had a betamon instead,7

Potential for a new Urdu dub of Digimon Adventure (1999),digimon,"Hi Everyone

So there's this kids channel in Pakistan called Kids Zone (email: info@kidzoneplus.com) who have previously expressed interested in dubbing Digimon, and have even been offered the rights to do so by Toei.

However there was some miscommunication and essentially what it boils down to is, the main negotiation was for Dragonball and that fell through because of unrelated reasons.

However! That means Digimon is still totally available for them to dub! The quality of their dubs is so amazing, especially when compared to the original Hindi dubs we all grew up with, and they make a point of dubbing insert songs in all of their programmes.

We never had that before, and only had ONE instance of dubbed Hindi Butter-Fly which is now lost media.

This is a really fantastic opportunity for a whole new generation to fall in love with Digimon in an area of the world which doesn't get a whole lot of love and attention.

If you guys wouldn't mind dropping these guys an email, and just briefly stating how good a product Digimon would be for them, it could really galvanise them to go for the rights properly this time, rather than an afterthought.

Please tell any Digimon fan you know to do the same!",Potential for a new Urdu dub of Digimon Adventure (1999) ,potential for a new urdu dub of digimon adventure ,potential for a new urdu dub of digimon adventure ,9

Question about Digimon Survive,digimon,"So I got around to finally play Survive on the switch. I tried to play it completely blind aside from the saving/loading cheats cause I wanted some decent affinity raise for battle purposes.

I got the highest morality percentage with harmony and wrathful being the second and last. So I thought for certain that I’m on the Moral route, I even got Agumon’s normal evolution line up until his Mega, I ended up getting his Harmony evolution, which I don’t mind, but I didn’t realized that I ended up in the harmony route, despite that my moral level is still the highest. When does the game determine which path/ending you’ll end up in, I’m assuming its after we got back from the real world?

Since the final boss a virus and my Mega is a data I’ve been having a hard time fighting it, my digimon kept getting one shoted. Is this an impossible fight, am I stuck? Am I gonna force myself to play the super easy mode to beat the final boss?

Also in my route Prof and Miyuki ended up getting killed as well

And for some reason I wasn’t able to get Minoru and Saki’s megas and I don’t understand why",Question about Digimon Survive ,question about digimon survive,question about digimon survive,4

Just finished Digimon Savers/Data Squad,digimon,"Me and my homie continue our journey to go through all the digimon seasons and movies

We just finished Digimon Savers. Ngl, it doesn't deserve the bad rep people gave it. There are genuinely good characters and stories in the season. Masaru, Thoma, Ikuto are all amazing characters that have fleshed out personalities.

Masaru may seem hot headed and viloent at times but is honestly soft at heart which can be seen how he treats Ikuto when Masaru brings him home. His realization that he is not a one man army, it's through Agumon can he truly take control of the dangerous situation that the other digimon presents and vice versa for agumon. Be it god, human or a Digimon, your actions and carry weight and what you do and not do carry consequences that can't be avoided. A ""TRUE MAN WOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS ACTIONS AND STAYS TRUE"" as he would say.

Thoma showing signs of jealousy when he saw Masaru alive mom and healthy sister. Later treating chika (Masaru's little sister) kindly and Masaru's mother kindly, especially after their hospitality. There was a whole episode where Thoma wanted to take them out for the plan ever because it was Chikas Birthday. It was honestly adorable. Later revealed how he still feels guilty for his own mother death, how he would stand infornt a oncoming truck just to save her. How in his toxic family, it has his weak sister that was his becon of light. It was to save her that he took up medicine. The frustration and hate he felt for his father who wouldn't stand up for Thoma or his late wife, the indecisiveness of his father that led to Thomas hate for the rest of his family. Thoma had a interesting rival villain that kinda dropped the ball but the idea was there.

Ikuto a humon child with a digimon heart. An interesting character, separated with his parents as a baby and raised by a digimon. He ended his losing digimon mother to a human. He grew to hate humans. It was through his interaction to Masaru and the gang to finally see that humans aren't evil as he thought. Him going to the human world, how alien he felt and further increased when he wanted by both humans and then even digimon. How he ended up taking this positively and deciding to become a bridge that would allow for a world digimons and humans could live in peace.

The BIGGEST issue I have with the season is Yoshino

She is set up as a character with an inferiority complex. Her mother is a amazing piano player, her sisters are told to us as also talented. And that she was always the one who screwed up. She paired with 2 talented kids. Masaru who just showed up to the team and already he's doing a great job and Thoma the child prodigy. But like she.......never does anything or has an issue with this. Her rival villains are usually comical and she never really had any growth. The only time she gets something like this was the episode where she gets her perfect evolution but that honestly felt like tokenism. She later paired with Ikuto alot but that kinda feels like she's tagging along. Overall Yoshino is a character that wasn't used at all.

There were a few issues here and there but I found the final royal knights arc felt rushed kinda weird, and how they were setting up Masaru's dad as the second coming of jesus but that's fine, it got the job done.


The story still holds up, a good villain, character progression is pretty good (except you Yoshino). Overall pretty entertaining",Just finished Digimon Savers/Data Squad ,just finished digimon saversdata squad,just finished digimon saversdata squad,5

Adventure 02 Reboot,digimon,"If we were to get an adventure 2 reboot then what is one thing you guys would want.

For me its the evolution of the new generation digidestined. While the armor evolution and Jogress evolution were ok, I felt that one of the problems is that they required either an item or another partner. To me this almost the same thing as what happened in digimon adventure 1 where Tai and Matt were the only ones to reach mega, while the others reached (mostly Takeru) ultimate level. I know that the whole point was the dark towers preventing them from achieving champion level, and that armor evolution a strong bypass to them. The same thing as well when it came to jogress evolution. 

So my take is that in the reboot Davis, Yolei, Cody, and Ken will still have the same champion level evolution, but after that they should have new ultimate and mega digimon evolution minus Ken since he would get banchostingmon later on

Although it might be for the best to make those four the main characters while takeru and Hikari are secondary characters since they already achieved mega by the end of the digimon adventure 2020 reboot. Or at least have them coach the new generation",Adventure 02 Reboot ,adventure  reboot,adventure  reboot,2

Softlock glitch in the DW4 dungeon Virus Lab,DigimonWorld,"Made a thread on the GameFaqs board about this and still no reply received, so I thought about obtaining one from Reddit.

One of the things that bothers me when playing the dungeon is the second area, before the Malo boss fight. When arriving at the pits that have hovering platforms, they don't appear, which makes the pit uncrossable. I figured out this is caused by 2 situations:

\- before defeating Malo, if you have a colored item either equipped or carried in the inventory.

\- after defeating Malo, when the dungeon is revisited, regardless of difficulty and having or not having any colored items. (this means if you play on NG+ with a Mega, you won't be able to go to the boss area).

Only Virus Lab has this. It doesn't happen in Electro Mine.

Digimon World 1 - Are you locked into an evolution before it actually happens?,DigimonWorld,"Hey guys,

I have a Leomon that dies within 1 hour of loading my save. I wanted to save it because I'd only been training with it, thinking I would surely get my 3rd ultimate in a row if I did so. Turned out, as with how DW1 works, of course that wasn't correct. My stats were just slightly skewed towards... well, not going up to Ultimate.

So I decided to check the 'evolution tool' made by SydMontague (thanks a bunch for your hard work!) despite my initial intention being to let me get what I get... I'd already broken that rule by un-Numemon-ing my Elecmon (the rules of thumb I found and used that worked to not get the turd from Agumon, did unfortunately not work for Elecmon).

According to the evo tool, my defense was a bit too low for Andromon, the rest was all where it needed to be or much higher. Weight was also too low. So I forcefed it to get the weight up, then scolded it a couple times to get the discipline back to 100%. It still died (the defense could be neglected with the discipline bonus requirement).

Decided to try out cheat engine for the first time in forever, narrowed down which values would change the stats, weight and even the lifespan and battle count. Even if I change all stats to 600/6000, battle count to 60, weight to 40 (should be between 35 and 45), Leomon still dies. The values do take effect - brains are officially at 477, if I change them to 500 and I enter battle, I can give specific move commands.

Leomon also still dies if I change the lifespan to 240 and praise him, or 359 or 360 and let the clock roll over to the next hour.

So... I can't help but think that no matter what one would do, even if you would fairly obtain the correct requirements, your digimon will still die if you only manage to get to the requirements 1 hour or so before the death. Because no matter what I try, Leomon seems to be locked into death and nothing is changing that... that's odd, isn't it?

True, I have not found the care mistakes value in cheat engine to tamper with that, but I'm 99% sure that I have 0 mistakes. Maybe 1 tops? And it should be under 5 for Andromon, so still should not be a problem.

I don't get it. The forcefeeding and scolding it should be enough - no cheating needed. But even when I cheat it doesn't work.",Digimon World 1 - Are you locked into an evolution before it actually happens? ,digimon world   are you locked into an evolution before it actually happens,digimon world   are you locked into an evolution before it actually happens,12

My digimon are 15 days old so theyre probably going to die soon, so im thinking of just waiting till then to do the training i figured out but in the meantime i need help. Im tired of soft resetting and i know if i just train these digimon in the gym theyre just gonna peace out.
