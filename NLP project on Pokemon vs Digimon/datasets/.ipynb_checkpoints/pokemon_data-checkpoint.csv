"If you're finding playing Pokemon a bit too easy, here's something I've been doing to spice it up a bit more.",2,11ocxih,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11ocxih/if_youre_finding_playing_pokemon_a_bit_too_easy/,5,"So I've been playing Pokemon a long time, pretty much as long as there's been Pokemon I've been playing it. I've been imposing a self set of rules because of both how easy pokemon is, especially once you know the tricks, and because of a few things I've noticed. 

Skip this paragraph if you just want the rules,but one thing I've noticed when I play Pokemon games is that I always end the game with so much money and so much healing items, and I started to think about why. I think that being able to walk back to a pokemon center and heal, is too convenient, so nobody ever wastes their super potion on a route or in a gym, when they can just go back to the pokemon center and spent a grand total of 45 seconds healing all their mons and getting back to the spot they were at before. The only time the player is really pushed is if they are in caves, but modern caves really don't hold up to OG caves like Mt. Silver, RBY Victory Road, RSE Victory Road, even Mt. Moon (say what you will about Mt. Moon but I have vivid childhood memories of getting lost and feeling like it took forever to navigate). But since nothing ever stops the player from just heading back to the PC whenever, a large chunk of the game like healing items, and even money have less of an impact. 

Alright sorry for the exposition here's the rules I use when I play Pokemon games, just to add a little spice.

-Once you enter a route/gym/hideout, you may not leave that route/gym/hideout through the same way you came in. You have begun a journey forward, go somewhere that isn't where you came from. This means no casual walks back to the Pokemon Center when your 1st mon gets poisoned by Bug Catcher Arnie's Weedle or whatever.

-Save before you enter a route/gym/hideout, if you black out on the route reload the save. Blacking out = no punishment aside from losing a trivial amount of money that you weren't going to spend anyway. Reloading the save means having to refight all the trainers. Now there are stakes. It's like a gentle Nuzlocke. This means that you need to actually prepare for your journey down the next route by buying and using healing items.

-No avoiding wild battles via running away or repels. I think that being able to avoid wild pokemon removes the struggle and adventure aspect of journeying down a route to the next town. The journey wasn't memorable because you avoided everything except two trainers. But when you have to battle every wild Mon, and your PP is running out, and the wild mons keep whittling your health down and tossing the occasional status effect, that's when you feel the struggle, the danger, the adventure of it all. Making it to the next city with one paralyzed pokemon left at 15 HP? Now that was a memorable journey.

-Set mode on. I feel like this doesn't need explaining but being able to always switch to a water type when you know a fire type is coming is hella cheat codes. If anyone complains about how easy the game is but plays with switch mode on, you deserve to get turned into a Shedinja without Wonder Guard.

-No using free heals on routes. This one is a bit minor but some games have the convenient nurse right outside the cave who heals all your pokemon. Don't use it. Or if you think that's a bit harsh, cause sometimes they have a long route, followed by a nurse before a cave, and then another route after the cave, then just limit yourself to once per route.

These are some rules that add some fun to my playthroughs, feel free to comment yours I'd love to read them. Nuzlockes aren't the only way to play some difficult pokemon.",1678516531.0

I always have had rose-colored glasses to the RBY era as they were my introduction into the series.  I know they weren't the best, but they were my favorite, as they got me hooked on Pokemon.  So why did Scarlet move to number 1?  This was the first time that I got to share the adventure with my son.  We wondered through Paldea together and talked about all the cool things we saw as we chose our own unique paths.  One of us would discover some secret and then show the other. We built our own unique teams, and discussed why we liked them.  My favorite moment is when he ran into a Shiny Bagon, and he lost his mind as he had never seen a shiny before.  And when I explained that shinies were a rare form, he was smiling for the rest of the day.  He knew he had encountered something special, and immediately evolved it into Salamence.  These memories are something I will carry with me for the rest of my life, and no Pokemon game will ever replace the thrill and excitement I felt as a father going on a Pokemon journey for the first time with my son in Paldea.",1678469649.0

[OC] All of the behind the scenes work that goes into turning my artwork into enamel pins! Featuring the Eeveelutions!,9,11nz0kw,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11nz0kw/oc_all_of_the_behind_the_scenes_work_that_goes/,2,"(~~for some reason I cannot seem to post an image? Sorry about that, find the referenced images linked below!~~ I realize now it is way past 5pm UTC \^\^; For some reason I thought UTC=PST, my bad! Since this isn't a finished product artwork and more of a behind the scenes thing, leaving it up, but admin, if not okay please feel free to take it down).

I'm working on creating an enamel pin series of Floofelutions -- floofy eeveelutions -- (which see my comment below if you'd like to pre-order via my Kickstarter; it ends tomorrow, Saturday, March 11 at 11am CST!) and I thought it'd be fun to show you the behind the scenes view of what it's like after you've finished the artwork and are working with a manufacturer to create the pins!

I am working with hard enamel pins, which means not only is the enamel (the color filling) hard in texture, the entire pin is made up of a metal base. My two favorites I use are either gold metal or black nickel.

Picture creating pins sort of like stained glass; everywhere there's an enclosed space is a single fill enamel color. But as you can see in some of my examples there's colors layered on top of those colors (i.e. Sylveon, Espeon's head gem) which is what is then called ""screenprinting"" where you pay to have an extra color printed on top of that base enamel color.

Then there's the 'cutouts' and 'recessed metal' bit of a pin. Cutouts are self-explanatory: they're the parts that the manufacturer will literally cut out so there's a hole in the design, i.e. Espeon's tail. Then there's 'recessed metal' which is where the metal is recessed -- i.e. lower than the rest of the design -- to create a depth but not having to fully cut it out. This works for super small areas where a cutout isn't feasible.

I also strive to make sure my designs are uniform across the board, which given how much the Eeveelutions can vary because of their ears or tails is pretty tricky! So you can see that all of them were measured in the paw-to-paw location as that stays the same for this design to make sure they are all kept within proportion of each other.

Check out four of my designs below and hope you enjoyed this behind the scenes look! Be sure to check out my comment if you're interested in getting your own! ♥

Story Time.,26,11npjqb,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/11npjqb,5,"TL;DR: 30 year old man relives his childhood dreams last felt with Pokemon Yellow, share your love for the game and what you like the most about it. 

I wanted to share a little story,

Im a 30 y/o man (awaiting an ASD diagnosis) who has played almost every pokemon main game so far, ever since platinum I just stopped enjoying them after a few hours, games became easier and easier and I just didn't get the same feeling from them in the same I did from Yellow, Blue, Gold and Crystal (I plaited them from day of release too) I got Scarlet on day of release and fell in love with it, the sheer idea that I spent 20+ hours playing before getting one badge just because I let the game take me where it wanted, trying to explore everything I could before getting to the school, once I'd done the school part of the story I discovered picnic shiny hunting and went around catching pokemon, exploring and shiny hunting, proceeded with the games story to boost my jumpluff so that it was strong enough to tank moves and put pokemon to sleep, I must have caught half a box of Shiny pokemon, all with only 1 badge, this is truly what this game has to offer! This is what the pokemon series needed to become what it used to be, I felt like a kid again. 

My switch needed to be repaired because my joycons weren't working properly and the repair team messed up, said my switch was fine and factory reset it, all my time and experience just gone...

...only difference is that this time my daughter had her birthday and we got her a switch with pokemon Violet, she fell in love with it the way I did when I played pokemon yellow, I decided to keep booting new games until we both had all three starters, I think found out how to get false swipe and raced my way through to the tera scyther, I was determined to get back to where I was, I got the scyther, obtained false swipe and then I have continued on from where I last left off, only this time, trying to follow the story, catching every new pokemon on the way and doing some occasional shiny hunting for the shinies I used to have.

I have just finished the game story line and I'm now going to fully complete my pokedex and try to re-obtain all pokemon has shiny (excluding locked ones)",1678455721.0

Day 0,200: Misdreavius!

Huh, I did not know it was spelled like that until today. I would have sworn on everything that it was Misdrevious. Whoops.

But hey, it's the feminine ghost Pokemon!

This cute ghost always makes me think of Flurrie from Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door -- I think it's the necklace and Flurrie being ghost like herself. I'm a little tiffed I didn't name my Misdreavius Flurrie now :c

Speaking of which; I'm not the biggest fan of this shiny but I'm also not super against it. Misdreavius turns into a really off shade of gold/green -- While an ugly shade I do think it assists with the spooky coloring. I can't really complain because it *fits* even if I dislike the color.

I actually have this line done in my Shiny Living Dex! My Shiny Misdreavius is named Poe, named after the little ghosts in Legend of Zelda! It's an adorable little thing.

I think Misdreavius is pretty unique in terms of design -- I think it's interesting and playful but I don't have a lot of high attachments to the Pokemon itself. Evne shiny hunting for one twice didn't really give me a good story for it :/

**C-**

A one-page essay on why collecting Pokémon cards as an adult is acceptable; Written brilliantly and in its entirety by artificial intelligence.,0,11od4p2,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11od4p2/a_onepage_essay_on_why_collecting_pokémon_cards/,14,"Collecting Pokémon cards is often associated with children and nostalgia from the 90s, but in recent years, more and more adults have been getting into the hobby. Some people may question the acceptability of adults collecting these cards, but in reality, there are many reasons why it is a perfectly acceptable hobby for people of all ages.

Firstly, collecting Pokémon cards can provide a sense of joy and excitement for people who have fond memories of the franchise from their childhood. Many adults who collect these cards do so for the nostalgia factor, and there's nothing wrong with reliving happy memories from the past.

Secondly, collecting Pokémon cards can be a fun and rewarding hobby in its own right. The cards themselves are beautifully designed and intricately detailed, and the thrill of completing a set or finding a rare card can be incredibly satisfying. Plus, the trading and social aspects of the hobby can provide opportunities for people to connect and bond over a shared interest.

Thirdly, collecting Pokémon cards can have a financial aspect to it as well. While not all cards will appreciate in value, some rare or highly sought-after cards can be worth a significant amount of money. For some collectors, the potential for financial gain adds another layer of excitement and motivation to their hobby.

Lastly, collecting Pokémon cards is no different from collecting any other type of item, such as stamps, coins, or art. Just because it's associated with a children's franchise doesn't mean it's any less valid as a hobby for adults. In fact, many hobbies that were once considered ""childish"" have become more widely accepted as adult hobbies in recent years, such as comic book collecting or playing video games.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why collecting Pokémon cards as an adult is perfectly acceptable. It can bring joy, provide a fun and rewarding hobby, offer financial potential, and is no different from collecting any other item of interest. As long as it brings happiness and fulfillment to the individual, there is no reason why anyone should feel ashamed or embarrassed for collecting Pokémon cards.",1678517255.0

I am 30 yo Pokemon fan (I was 6-7 when it first came out in my country) and never played any game besides from playing on friends GB.
I finally bought my Switch console and I would like to ask, which game edition do you suggest to start from?

I am thinking about latest Scarlet/Violet but I heard they are bugged and there is even problem with saves being deleted :o
Arceus looks awesome but this is ""different"" than other games.
Also thinking about Pikachu/Eevee due to nostalgia.

What do you think?",1678467450.0
Why don't we have reverse Eevee? It would be such a cool mechanic,0,11o5rk0,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11o5rk0/why_dont_we_have_reverse_eevee_it_would_be_such_a/,12,"We now have multiple Pokemon that can evolve into a few different evolutions, with Eevee being the most well known example. However, we are now nine generations in and still haven't gotten the inverse: a Pokemon that can evolve from multiple preevolutions.

Think about how cool of a mechanic this could be in the game: As a type for the stage 1, normal would probably be the best fit, but parallel to Eevee, the preevolutions could be all sorts of types. The preevolutions could all have different abilities and movesets that the stage 1 could inherit. That would leave you with an incredibly customizable Pokemon, where you have no clue what to expect when facing it, until it actually attacks.

I can only see two issues with this and both would be pretty easy to fix:

* When breeding evolved Pokemon, the babies become the unevolved form. In this case with multiple unevolved forms, simply have the baby decided by ability, as those should still be able to be traced back to the basic form the parent-Pokemon originally evolved from.
* It could be kinda weird for the trading card game:

1. In the trading card game, a stage 1 card usually has marked what Pokemon it evolves from, and there is only room for one on the cards. Not a flawless solution, but you could simply not mark it on the card, and instead give each of the basics an ability that basically says ""You can evolve *That Pokemon* onto *This Pokemon.* This counts as an evolution."" (Last part is important because the TCG has some special rules of when you can evolve)
2. The variable attacks. Very similar solution: Use an ability as well! ""This Pokemon can use attacks from its preevolutions. It still needs to fulfill the energy requirements."" (Sorry if the formulation feels off, English isn't my native language so the trading cards I have also don't have their wordings in English)

This works quite well since the TCG's abilities are quite different from the games in a lot of occasions anyway so it wouldn't matter that those wouldn't be abilities in the games.",1678494476.0

I picked it up to play with my younger brother and sister in-law because they asked me to play with them. I've enjoyed the interactions that this game has let me have with them. It's incredibly fun to tear into this the low quality aspects with a group. While this is my first Pokemon game that I've seriously played, I've heard a lot about Pokemon from my extended family so I wasn't going in completely blind.

I've done 3/5 Starfall Street, 4/5 Path of Legends. 6/8 Victory Road.  
It's the Psychic Gym that broke me and made me want to write this post. The gym test is banal and insulting, and it's clumsily executed - you can button mash the emotion prompts repeatedly during the time window (why?). 

The plot hasn't been very engaging. With the exception of the Starfall sections, but they're so short and I expect it to disappoint in the end.

Yes, we exist because and theory has the right to life.

Especially when there is nothing wrong with this theory.

I just happened to notice recently that the sharp end of the Meowscarada mask, lowered down, look like the fangs of a saber-toothed tiger.

Also, this Pokemon has a relatively short tail. They could have made him a long tall, but they made it short.

Which also makes for me a certain resemblance to a saber-toothed tiger.

**200: Misdreavus**

Hey look! It's an incomplete Johto Pokémon line! 

Actually, just how much Misdreavus was screwed over doesn't even stop there. Despite being the ONLY ghost type added in Johto, at a time where the Gastly line was the only other Ghost at all, Misdreavus wasn't even used by the supposed Ghost specialist in the region. It's such a baffling exclusion - you had two options and you went with Gastly evolutions for all of them, Morty. Just... what? Why?!

...but my complaints end there, really. Misdreavus could've been treated better, but it was a good design with an expressive personality. To compliment Gengar's creativity, the second ghost type was a more traditional banshee, just made adorable, and with a feminine witchy vibe with beautiful hair. I adore feminine and elegant Pokémon a lot, and Misdreavus works wonders as a cohesive, ghostly design that is both cute and pretty, setting up for it's evolution into the witchy Mismagius later on.

It also got an incredible Paradox form in Gen 9, so it's certainly a Pokémon who got treated much better over time. But I can't quite gush about that one yet, even if it's super pretty and badass and *who's a good little overpower-Pokemon-immediately-banned-to-ubers, yes, you are\~* D'awww, the Pokémon world couldn't handle it\~

But as for Misdreavus in a vacuum? Beautiful Pokémon with immaculate vibes, and I'm happy it got treated better over time. The only reason it's in **B+ Tier** and not any of the As is because of the steep competition and a few complaints about Mismagius I'll get to later - you might claim that's unfair to Misdreavus, but cute pre-evolutions aren't my favorite archetype, so they generally don't get to the A Tiers on their own.

I understand gameplay wise, yes they are regional variants but lord wise, if they aren’t actually related to the Kanto birds, that would make them convergents of them? 

Not sure if this is discussed before but I think we might have another case where gamefreak had a loose idea and then decided to go about it a different way, I.e nidroian being two Pokémon where future games given one Pokémon two different gender forms.",1678456080.0

I was feeling nostalgic for the past and remembered how I introduced Pokémon to my niece who was 2 years old at the time.

I showed her the first episode of the show when it was on Netflix, and within 3 minutes of seeing pikachu she was enamored with him.

After the scene I linked above where pikachu used his tail to swat the ball back at Ash, she giggled and muttered to herself “Pikachoooo!”. I ended up getting her a lot of pikachu themed presents that year.

Now she’s bigger but she audibly goes “Awww” when I show her the old chubby pikachu design!

I've been collecting what they leave behind since we can't sell it, and giving the TCG codes and any cards needed to a friend who plays competitively. Well anyways, I now have thousands of cards taking up space, and the card stacks are ever-growing bc kids will be kids. I was handing them out at the park to the kids in the neighborhood, but there's been lots of rain this year making it difficult to encounter them and the cards themselves aren't waterproof obviously. I'll be at work when the sun finally comes out and I'll miss them. :(

I was thinking of putting up a display on the table under the pagoda where the kids can take from it freely. The families come in herds, with many mothers and MANY kids at a time so they would be less likely to allow just one child to take it all and would be forced to share it to avoid chaos. What would you use to put, say, about 50 cards in? To waterproof but also keep them rigid. That I can buy in bulk (at hopefully a relatively cheap price)? I have bad experiences with just ziplocks baggies (bent cards, ripped bags), and would like to put them in a bit more formal looking boxes. There must be something, but I can't think of a name of the ""item"" the box to put them in that I can buy in some sort of bulk to hand them out. It's probably something super obvious but the words just escape me and I've been trying to think of it for weeks now. But most the stuff I come across is just not ""card sized"" or holds too many nor comes in bulk.

I've already partitioned the cards into various mixes, they each have commons, medium, rares, vmaxes, holographics and more. So each pack has somewhat equal the goodies they can enjoy.",1678423715.0

A bit of a different post today -- A very long super post catching me up because I am *so behind*! A lot of these are gonna be quickfire just so I can get them out so uwu let's get this show on the road!

0,191: Sunkern!

&#x200B;

[Art by  Doopliss on Zerochan!](https://preview.redd.it/u4earngrutma1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=16aa1740d38a2ddb5c98dc54ae37d80ff537d429)

So Hoppip was supposed to represent a seed but I expressed how it kind of made no sense that it was pink and cat like -- I still think it makes little to no sense. Especially when Sunkern is just a few lines down! What they did wrong with Hoppip they did right with Sunkern!

I think Sunkern is such an adorable concept -- It's a little sunflower seed!! LIke -- LOOK AT IT!!

It looks like it's having a good time and I'm here for it. It's such a cool concept that I'm glad that they did right --

I actually have a shiny one of these -- I can't remember if I evolved it or not but it's named ""Pandora"" and I was hunting it on a mirage island on ORAS! She may be a Sunflora now -- I can't really remember >v<;;

Overall I'd put Sunkern in the **B** rank. I think it's a super fun concept that they pulled off really well. I wish they'd take these simple ideas and make them into Pokemon like back then -- I feel like sometimes they go *too* complex with designs lately that they lose out on the charm.

Like where is my DUST BUNNY POKEMON??? I'M WAITING GAME FREAK

0,192: Sunflora!

&#x200B;

[Art by Pokedump on tumblr!](https://preview.redd.it/8ut7r2nbvtma1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=995956e4ec28479e8f013091abd6365c49d1c628)

While I really like Sunkern, I actually don't like Sunflora nearly as much. Which is a shame because Sunflowers are my favorite flowers! I love Sunflowers and feel like they could have done this Pokemon really well -- but they just... didn't?

And it's not even the simplicity of it. You can make designs simple and still work -- Sunflora just... lacks Sunkern's cheer, I think? There's just something off about it.

Honestly I wish they looked more like the adorable Sunflowers in Mario Sunshine. I adored those things when I'd play that game.

But sadly, despite the really good start and my bias for sunflowers, Sunflora still just.. lacks :c Which sucks.

I did like the minigame in S/V when there were like 10 running around you though. That was fun.

**C-**

0,193: Yanma!

&#x200B;

[Art by Decy on twitter!](https://preview.redd.it/g1ei1yxlvtma1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f35eff817cf58aa3a50839999e032c527ed29445)

For a Dragonfly Pokemon, Yanma has a really super interesting design. I thing it's aesthetically nice to look at it and Pokemon stays pretty loyal to the behavior of an actual dragonfly -- Seeing these Pokemon move in the 3D models is really fun because of how erratic they fly! 

While I think these little *buggers* are adorable, they do lack a certain... something to them.

I haven't ever heard of them being used for competitive or even during normal playthroughs; Even with an added evolution later on it doesn't seem to help this line at all which just sort of leaves them abandoned in the 'useless bug' category :c which sucks because they're so cute and interesting! I love dragonflies!

But yeah -- Overall I'll have to put Yanma in **C**.

0,194: Wooper!

&#x200B;

[ cona\_25 on twitter!](https://preview.redd.it/nfk4byhhwtma1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f2178d0b88b9422475a9fcf0f4b8a51e3fd2f9b7)

Lookie at the little Wopper -- whoops I meant Whooper -- Defiinitely don't need to mistake those >v<

But yeah, it's the little axolotl bean! I ***love*** Wooper. Look at its dopey little smile! If you weren't aware already I enjoy Pokemon that loo like they're happy to be alive. Wooper's just a happy little dude and I adore this huggable bean!

Wooper's also pretty memorable to me -- For a long time Wooper was the longest Masuda hunt I ever did. I was well over the 1k's and was struggling hardcore with maintaining the drive to keep going. Coincidentally I had seen a video of an albino exolotl and showed my best friend the video, expressing that it looked like a shiny Wooper

My best friend, knowing I was driving myself nuts with the hunt, made an off hand comment about how I didn't have one and I *immediately* got one as soon as she sent the message. In honor of the albino Axolotl in the video, my shiny Wooper's named Ripley! UwU

But yeah, Wooper's just a cute and adorable bean with an interesting and unique design that leads into one of the (in my opinion) one of the best gen 2 Pokemon to use in game.

Wooper's definitely a **A** Pokemon. 

**Paldean Wooper:** I actually used a Paldean Wooper in my playthrough of S/V and I'll be honest -- I'm not the biggest fan. I prefer the OG Wooper :c It's just... not as much of a huggable bean. **C-**

0,195: Quagsire!

&#x200B;

[Art by Berlin Lopez on tumblr!](https://preview.redd.it/4omn9pf4ytma1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a92bb61d9dd7bd17cdb291ea29ca4efc576d6973)

So, I'll start off the bat that I adore Pokemon that can completely evade their weaknesses just because of their unique typing or abilities. I know that Quagsire is 4x weak to grass, but I'm always so interested in the fact that it's ground typing can completely evade the electric weakness it would have if it was just water! I remember Bertha's Quagsire threw me off *so much* in Diamond and Pearl!

Visually also I just love this Pokemon. It falls into the ""it's just happy to be alive"" and so I can't hate it. I've never used a Quagsire in a game but I wish I could! It's such a fun little dude!

I also have a shiny one of these -- with a less interesting story than Ripley but it's always fun to have a completed line in the Shiny Living Dex!

The only complaints I really have about Quagsire is the 4x weakness to grass -- while also just being *a little* bland? Like, I have no complaints but I also wouldn't complain if there was a little more visually to the Pokemon.

I still love Quagsire though and I'm more than okay with putting it in **A+**

**Paldean Quagsire:** I used one in my playthrough and I'm not gonna lie. I wasn't a fan. I felt like the Pokemon wasn't tanky enough to live long enough and there was just better options in this region that made it less likely to use. Although it *is* the only reason why I beat Eri when I had to poison stall her Annihliape. Regardless this Pokemon's going in the **D** rank. I just... I don't vibe as well with the Paldean forms of this mon.

Day 0,196: ESPEON!!

&#x200B;

[Art by OhSweetsSweetie on tumblr!](https://preview.redd.it/ooyqtwemztma1.png?width=420&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f479ddeb9564e2cd8f79a7d084d66d37ad9e91cd)

&#x200B;

I LOVE ESPEON!! SO MUCH!!!

It's an adorable little psychic cat -- did anybody expect anything different? Espeon's as adorable as it is powerful! 

But the biggest reason for love comes from Pokemon Colosseum when the two Pokemon you start off with is Umbreon and Espeon! I remember becoming enamored with this badass psychic cat the moment I saw her in this game and she became a star player in my team. 

While Espeon isn't my favorite out of the eeveelutions it's definitely in the top 3. I've considered getting matching tattoo's with my best friend of an Espeon/Umbreon duo because even though it isn't my *favorite*, I still like it enough that I wouldn't complain about matching on with my bestie!

The only thing that I have to complain about when it comes to Espeon is that as more Psychic types were introduces and more options were brought up; The less needed it was. Espeon just kind of became a token eeveelution which is a little upsetting but I guess on par for how Eeveelutions work overall. Even if they're important and well loved they don't really live up to the love in terms of being useful in battle.

I still think Espeon is amazing though and I love that it got put in Unite too <3

**A+**

Day 0,197: Umbreon!!

&#x200B;

[Art by OhSweetsSweetie on tumblr!](https://preview.redd.it/90vjhhcl0uma1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2fa7046f5935acbf713019ae38f0ebf844bd3ab7)

While I adore Umbreon, I don't like them as much as I love Espeon. I can get behind the really cool and regal design but it's far more dog like which isn't as appealing to my cat obsessed heart.

For some reason looking for fanart of Umbreon unlocked the memory more than Espeon but I remember being young and on the internet and finding videos online of dramatic love storeis between Espeon and Umbreon -- Using Deviantart inspired fanart to tell the stories of two Eevees in love that are torn apart by.. something or other and evolving to save each other or something lol

They were so cringey but I remember watching each and every one of them I could get my hands on (as well as the cringey Sonic ones but shhh this is a Poke list)

But yeah! Regardless of cringey childhood bias I like Umbreon for what it is but not as much as Espeon. It doens't help that I don't think it's nearly as powerful as Espeon so it gets -- no pun intended -- overshadowed. 

I will admit that it has an awesome shiny though!

**B**

Day 0,198: Murkrow!

&#x200B;

[Art by  1-084 on Deviantart!](https://preview.redd.it/v81kkoce1uma1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=39c9e84e6d289d0146f15d699489f861c692d9b3)

Honestly, like HootHoot I feel like it wasn't hard to get this design right. 

But they really did get this design right. I love Murkrow's cute little witches hat added to the crow design! It's so creative and really adds to the design.

It's also hilarious that Murkrow has the same catch rate as Palkia... *for some reason*.

Like I'm so glad that this dumb bird is harder to catch than a literal time god! It's amazingly funny but makes me groan anytime I need to catch a Murkrow for my living dex (which means I normally have to catch two ugh)

But no, I do like Murkrow a lot. I've never used this line and haven't really had a huge drive *to* but the design is appealing enough to rank it at least above average.

Too bad it has a dumb bright pink shiny >:C

**C**

**0,199: Slowking!**

&#x200B;

[Art by AutobotTesla on Deviantart!](https://preview.redd.it/bo6mwle62uma1.png?width=225&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6330cbd900d11477b59017865c468f96004bf262)

Slowking makes me so embarrassed aaaaa -- When I was playing S/V I so desperately wanted to use one on my team but I was really stupid and thought that the line went Slowpoke -> Slowbrow -> Slowking

I completely forgot that it was it's own evolution and you needed to evolve it a special way before it evolved int Slowbro jdakl;fjdsd

I was so upset because I actually really like Slowking. A lot of it may be nostalgia with the Pokemon's major inclusion in the second Pokemon movie; I remember when I saw this Pokemon on the tv I put it up on the same level as *legendaries* because it just seemed super important. 

I'm also a sucker for scarves and it looks like Slowking has one -- so visually I like it way more than Slowbro.

I'd put Slowking in the **B** rank!

**Galarian Slowking:** Nobody look the edge lord is here! No but fr this thing is so goofy looking I can't ever take it seriously. Slowking always gave a sage vibe but Galarian Slowking just kind of looks like a joke lmao. **D**.

"Ice types should resist Ground, Dragon and Flying and do neutral damage vs Water",1,11n3rdf,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11n3rdf/ice_types_should_resist_ground_dragon_and_flying/,14,"I don't understand why Ice has no resistances. It's sad that the only Ice type viable pokemon are Glass canon. Why? Pokemons like Mamoswine are big and they should be resistant, they should be tanky. Ice is hard, Ice is not an easy material to deal with. 

&#x200B;

You have to be though to resist in cold temperature, so why every Ice type pokemon is a chips that gets obliterated easily? 

&#x200B;

**Okay, you can't give em Grass and Bug resistance because Grass and Bug are already in a bad state.** 

&#x200B;

But Ground is a very strong type, being super effective against Fire, Rock, Steel, Poison and Electric, it's wouldn't hurt to have Ice resisting it since it's already a super effective typing vs Ground. 

&#x200B;

Dragon because it's already super effective vs Dragon and Dragon doesn't have many weaknesses, it's one of the strongest typing, so it's not like a resistance to it would hurt. 

&#x200B;

 Flying, because Flying is only resisted by Steel and Rock and is super effective against Fighting, Bug and Grass. And because I don't see Birds having enough power to crush ice. Most Birds can't stand the cold... 

&#x200B;

And for Offense, Ice should do neutral damage vs Water and the super effective damage should depend on the weather. 

&#x200B;

For example, an Ice type under a snowy weather would deal supereffective damage against Water because the cold from the weather would help him to freeze the water. 

&#x200B;

And on the opposite side, Water pokemons under rain should be able to do super effective damage against Ice pokemons since Ice melts faster when you have many drops of room temperature weather. 

&#x200B;

That would make an interesting use in the Weather. Weather moves would be more useful and interesting if it's could change the damage chart like this. I know Freeze Dry and Scald exists but it's would be an addition to these 2 moves. 

&#x200B;

Weather could also boost some passives like Thick fat. Thick fat should be 50% more effective under Snow and on the opposite side, under Harsh sunlight, Thick fat isn't effective. That's would make the game more strategic and Weather would play a major role. An effective Typing wouldn't be the only thing needed to beat your opponent which would add more challenge. 

&#x200B;

* **Rework of the Frozen status**

&#x200B;

Frozen shouldn't be a paralysis like Thunder Wave or Stun spore. It's should be more like a slow (big speed reduction + attack and attack spe reduction and def/def spe reduction). The pokemon would still be able to act but he would be greatly disabled which is the normal reaction of the body when you're in hypothermia. You're not completely paralyzed but you're clearly not in a great shape. 

&#x200B;

I think it's important to make Freezing different from Paralysis. Because I don't see what the difference is. I feel like Paralysis is easier to place but the pokemon can still move sometimes which is weird and Frozen is very hard to pull on but then it's completely prevent the enemy pokemon from moving/attacking. Making them different from each other would be nice. 

&#x200B;

**And Ice moves should be super effective vs any frozen target. No matter what typing they have, even if it's a Fire/Steel pokemon for example. If it's frozen, the Ice moves should do super effective damage.** 

&#x200B;

This way, freezing becomes a very interesting status. If you manage to freeze your opponent, he'll have to cure his freezing, otherwise you'll be able to place super effective hits no matter his typing. 

&#x200B;

Or if you think it's would be too OP, in that case we could only add a damage boost against Frozen target for Ice attacks, this way it's wouldn't be too ""OP"" but would still reward you for freezing your opponent. 

&#x200B;

What do you think about these changes? Ice would become a nice powerful typing with that set of moves.",1678395894.0

I support their passions and recognize there is a lot of value to be had and enjoyed there. I watched the remake of the first movie (Mewtwo strikes back) and was surprised at how deep some of the metaphorical values were.

That being said... Right now, to them it's something to watch. We haven't gotten into the video games yet, and I want to encourage them to embrace non-screen-based activities too, so I wanted to buy some cards and learn how to play the game with my eight year old. There seems to be a lot of packages out there. I know it's a collector's game, so to speak, but I just want to have whatever basic stuff we need to start out and enjoy learning the game without getting way deep into collecting and fine tuning decks and stuff.

For those who are into the card game, what would you recommend I get for a first purchase? Is there a package I can buy that will provide enough cards for two players and include everything we will need?

Thanks!",1678377256.0

Which Generation of games do you wish you had grown up with?,1,11mu9o8,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11mu9o8/which_generation_of_games_do_you_wish_you_had/,11,"Modern Pokemon games are great, but nothing beats the excitement of playing Pokemon with your friends at school in the era that those games first came out. I grew up in the Gen 1-3 era, but didn't start playing until Gen 2 (Gold). I bought Red afterwards since it was still being sold in stores at the time, but nobody was really playing Gen 1 anymore at that time so I didn't get to enjoy it to the fullest extent (though was able to trade some Gen 1 Pokemon to Gold). Gens 2 and 3 however are a different story. They were the newest and most popular games at the time and EVERYONE was playing them. You could trade and battle with friends, spread playground rumors and utilize all of the options available in the games that aren't really available in emulators today, such as Mystery Gift, mixing records in RSE, the Union Rooms in FRLG, E-reader cards to get specific key items, Action Replays/GameSharks and ToysRus giveaways. 

I feel I was lucky to fully experience those games at that time and glad I grew up with those games. Emulators and ROMs are great, but it's hard to fully emulate the experience you had playing those games when they first came out. Likewise some people may have preferred to grow up with later gens to fully experience playing with friends at that time, because when I was in middle school and highschool and the DS games were coming out, not as many people my age were playing anymore so it was a much more solo experience for me, whereas it wouldn't have been if they came out when I was in elementary school. Which era would you have preferred to grow up in?

**199: Slowking**

I have to admit, out of all of Johto's weird alternate evolutions, the one that makes the most sense is Slowking. In all honesty, I could've seen Slowking as an evolution to Slowbro - it's name and design are both considerable more intimidating, but even as a split path, this one actually seems to make sense. 

Granted, I've never been... especially fond of the Slowpoke line. If you were to check my previous entries, I criticized it's personality as being one dimensional and overly specific for a species of Pokémon, and admitted that a lot of it's humor was lost on me. However... I think Slowking becomes an exception, in that while it retains a ditzy, oafish look, it boasts actual intelligence in a ditzy way that befits the Psychic typing. Giving Slowpoke, a one dimensional line dependent on another Pokémon for it's only gimmick, a more regal and pompous design element worked surprisingly naturally, and made Slowking more respectable. 

I totally overlooked this design admittedly until Scarlet & Violet, which did it SO much justice. I love it's relationship with Oranguru and how it was implemented mechanically in addition to just Pokedex entries. The ideas of a genuinely intelligent, mystic scholar debating against a doofus pretending to be smart is just a legendary interaction - and Slowking's new signature move, ""Chilly Reception"", is flat out hilarious. Imagine being so unwitty that you tell a joke that causes a snowstorm... and leaving the battle in shame and embarrassment is just a phenomenal cherry on top.

The Slowpoke line was almost entirely confined to the C Tier, but after Generation 9... I have to concede that I immensely underrated Slowking. Take your crown, buddy, you've made it to the **B Tier** alongside all the Pokemon I like with no reservations.

**199\*: Galarian Slowking**

Siiiiiigh. Mark it down in your history books, people, today, I confess, that a Galarian variant for once is not actually an improvement. I admit - I'm biased in favor of the modern design philosophy, Galar and Paldea are my favorite mainline regions. But even I have to admit that this design is awful, ugly, and actually rather insulting. 

What's most insulting is that it's so close to being good! Like, you could've just made the whole thing purple and doubled down on the evil sorcerer vibe. This could've been the Ganondorf of Pokémon with an intimidating, yet regal stature. Instead, we got... this diseased looking, ugly mess of colors.

I hate it. I hate it more because I actually started to like the original. But either way, I won't beat a dead horse - I've yet to meet anyone who likes this form. And if you do, PLEASE tell me why in the comments. For now... **F Tier**.

Old website based fan game,3,11mghlk,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11mghlk/old_website_based_fan_game/,4,"I'm trying to remember the name of a old website fan game where you would load a picture of a location from one of the games and click on random spots to try and find pokemon. You could give your pokemon any move and the levels went past 100. The page layout was mainly white or gray, you didn't have a player model on the picture of the location, and to choose areas you'd click on an area list to load into whatever zone you pleased. I feel like the title was an acronym, Pokemon <insert acronym here>. I doubt it's still up but going through other reddit posts similar my question everyone says Pokemon Crator and I don't believe that's the game I'm remembering unless it changed a lot since I had played it. I remember playing it a lot of the Opera browser of the Wii so it was probably somewhere around 2008-2010 because I don't believe the 3DS was out yet and the Wii wasn't that new anymore.

Should Mushroom Pokémon become their own type in the future?,0,11n2zwb,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11n2zwb/should_mushroom_pokémon_become_their_own_type_in/,26,"Technically, a mushroom is not a plant, so I thought since we have so many Pokémon based on mushrooms now, maybe it is time to give them their own types. Since mushrooms are parasitic and absorb nutrients from trees and plants, their type can be effective against plant type Pokémon and also water wouldn't be effective on them as well, since a lot of mushrooms grow in moist places. As for types that could be effective against them, I would choose the bug type, since there are some species of bugs that eat mushrooms. Also, ice type moves would be effective on them, since mushrooms die in the wintertime because of the cold. I would also throw in the normal type, since a lot of creatures in our normal world, like to eat mushrooms.",1678394135.0

"If Frontier Brains Were Gym Leaders, What Types Would They Use?",2,11mjfhe,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11mjfhe/if_frontier_brains_were_gym_leaders_what_types/,3,"Title says it all. Tell me your thoughts in the comments.

Disclaimer: Some of my picks are slightly influenced by the anime because those teams fit each Frontier Brain really well. Also, I decided not have repeating types, so each Frontier Brain’s type will be unique to them.

Noland - Bug (Doesn’t have a canonical team, but because he has a Pinsir in Pokémon Masters I went with Bug.)

Greta - Fighting (Has a Heracross and Breloom in the games, and a Hariyama and Medicham in the anime. She also gives off the vibe of being a Fighting-Type trainer with her stance and her belt.)

Tucker - Fire (Has a Charizard in the games and an Arcanine in the anime. Also, he is known for being a performer, and Fire seems to be a fitting type for someone who is flashy in front of a crowd.)

Lucy - Poison (She likes snakes, and people often think of poison or venom when they think of snakes. Seviper is also arguably her most iconic Pokémon and appears both in the games and the anime.)

Spenser - Grass (If we forget about the two Grass types he had in the anime, Spenser just seems like a Grass type user due to his fondness for nature.)

Anabel - Psychic (Aside from having 3 Psychic types in the anime, I just think Psychic fits her well. She has this very elite vibe about her that makes her seem like she has some natural gift for raising powerful Pokémon, and the Psychic type matches that vibe. She also has a purple aesthetic, which helps.)

Brandon - Rock (He’s portrayed as a treasure hunter or a explorer of ancient ruins. We know that he has a Regirock and an anime-exclusive Solrock, but I can also see him with Pokémon like Aerodactyl or Relicanth due to his theme.)

Thornton - Steel (Again, he doesn’t have a canon team, but he does use a Bronzong in Pokémon Masters. He also seems like he would use a Magnezone.)

Dahlia - Ghost (Almost went with Flying because of her Togekiss and Zapdos. However, she does have a Dusknoir, and I could see her with a Drifblim or Mismagius. The Ghost type also kind of matches her hair, which I admit really isn’t saying much since lots of characters have dark black hair.)

Darach - Dark (Houndoom is an iconic Pokémon of his and the Dark type has yet to be used by any other Frontier Brain.)

Palmer - Normal (To me he just looks like he would specialize in the Normal type. Also, he has a Regigigas, and for some reason I can picture him with a Porygon-Z.)

Argenta - Dragon (This one was difficult because she doesn’t have a canon team and she’s not in Pokémon Masters. To decide, I considered which types have yet to be used by other Frontier Brains, which are: Water, Electric, Ice, Flying, Dragon, Ground, and Fairy. I chose to exclude Fairy because that type didn’t exist when Argenta was prevalent. I then narrowed it down to Flying and Dragon because the only Pokémon she’s been confirmed to use in any source of media is Dragonite in the manga. Flying kind of seemed anti-climatic, and honestly Argenta’s design makes her seem like she’s capable of wielding some powerful Pokemon, so I ended up choosing the Dragon type for her. I could legitimately see her using a Kingdra, Salamence, or Garchomp.)",1678338452.0

I vaguely remember in one of the older versions, I entered a cave to progress the game (can’t remember which cave) and I came across 3 Pokémon (they look like dogs/wolves) standing side by side. If you approach any one of them and interact, you will start a battle. As soon as you try and catch the Pokémon or/and attack it, it flees.

Once the battle screen fades, all three of the Pokémon run off and you cant find them again, Am I imagining it? I was about 9-10 years old when first playing it. It was one of the older games.

And if not. Does anyone know the name of the specific game and/or the three Pokemon names?

Carnivine annoys me because I find myself interacting with it much more than I should in Legends Arceus. I'm sick of seeing it.

"What Do You Look For In A Pokemon Game, AKA What Kind of Pokemon Player are You?",4,11lxssq,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11lxssq/what_do_you_look_for_in_a_pokemon_game_aka_what/,11,"What it says on the tin.  What is it that you play (or used to play) Pokemon for?  Story?  Gameplay?  Exploration?  Music?  Competitive? 

I started with Pokemon Gen 2 (Silver),  so I got spoiled right off the gate with a really dense, content-rich experience as my first Pokemon game, which also shaped my perspective on what a Pokemon game should be:  An RPG game that opens up the world to you, to explore every little nook and cranny, with lots of optional, but engaging, content to indulge in, as well as some non-linear progression for you to customize your adventure.  Let's break down Gen 2's progression style:

* It's linear up until Ecruteak City, after which you have the choice to go left towards Olivine and Cianwood or right to Mahogany and Lake of Rage.  Both are required (along with the Rocket Radio Tower Takeover) to finish the game, and you converge at Blackthorn City for the final badge.  Once you reach Kanto in the post-game, the entire region is open to you to complete in whatever order you desire, minus the Power Plant sidequest to open up Western Kanto.
* Optional areas (meaning you don't even have to set foot in them one time to complete the game):  Dark Cave (all three entrances), Ruins of Alph (and the second half of Union Cave), Whirl Islands, Tin Tower, Mt. Mortar, routes below Blackthorn City, most of Kanto's routes and caves (even moreso in HGSS, since Cerulean Cave and Seafoam Islands were restored).
* The caves that are present here are all dense and multi-floor, labyrinthine and have puzzles to solve (Strength puzzles in some caves, sliding ice puzzles in Ice Path).

So with such a dense experience as my first game, clearly an exploration heavy game, this is what I've come to expect from every title I'd play after this.  I actually played Gen 1 (Red) after Silver, and immediately felt the downgrade in terms of quality of life and what not, but it at least still offered that sense of exploration, and non-linear progression, which starts after you emerge from Rock Tunnel after the first three badges.

Then I would play Gen 3, and it was underwhelming, but still decent, especially Emerald with the Battle Frontier.  Coming off Gen 2 and its sheer content and feature richness, going to Gen 3 and seeing all the removed features for no apparent reason (like Day and Night, and animated Pokemon from Crystal, and the Radio, and no second region to explore) is what made it feel underwhelming to me.  But little did I know, this was actually the start of the series removing features every Generation, with no real reason as to why.

Gen 4 (Platinum is what I played) was pretty nice as well, and has plenty of nooks and crannies to explore, and optional areas.  The post-game with the Battle Area felt like a mini-region on its own to explore, since you could also do that in a non-linear fashion. 

Gen 5 (Black 1 is what I played, followed by White 2) is where I started to notice the shift in the design philosophy of Pokemon games.  Since these were the most story focused games at the time, they heavily sacrificed the ability to explore the region for this.  Not only that, but the map was a literal straight line to the Pokemon league, since the right half of the circle was closed off until the post-game.  The areas did at least feel dense still, and I did notice that all the optional sections were behind the HMs; I don't think you're required to use an HM to get through the main game.   Black and White 2 was much the same, but I was at least happy to see all the additional polish added to the presentation of these games.  Everyone finally animated, including all the generic trainers and even us, if you were in a wifi battle against another player.   I fell off the series after this game though.

It wasn't until Gen 8 (Shield I played specifically) that I tried to return...and that was when I really realized that the games just don't really care about exploration anymore.  That was the most boring, linear Pokemon game I've played yet; even more linear than Gen 5, which I didn't think was possible.  But what made it worse was that there's virtually no optional areas to explore in the game (DLC not included, only talking about the base game here), compounded with the fact that there were no longer any dungeons in the game either.  The only two caves in Galar are both hallways, and single-floor.  The only ""dungeon,"" if you can even call it that, was also just an elevator ride.   I think it was at this point that I started to realize that Pokemon is probably no longer a series about exploring anymore, and is just focused on whatever story they want to tell.  But, being a gameplay first gamer that wants to explore, obviously I don't care about a Pokemon story, so none of the 3D titles have appealed to me since.",1678285805.0

the dungeon themes are eerie and menacing, yet they keep a steady beat that fits in any location, from dark damp caves to abandoned houses and facilities.

the battle themes are just perfect. the wild battle theme is a more robust and basic version of the the trainer theme. it signals danger but its simplicity also represents how the pokemon youre battling is untrained and spontaneous. the trainer theme is of course the exact opposite; an intense symphony that doesnt yield until youve won. both of these themes play throughout the entire game and not once do they become dull to listen to.

Getting back into the pokémon games I played as a child should I use Hypno over Alakazam?,1,11m1j8r,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11m1j8r/getting_back_into_the_pokémon_games_i_played_as_a/,2,"For context and I'm still a bit annoyed when I remember it as a child my favourite pokémon was Alakazam I thought he was the coolest pokémon that existed and when I got the game I got Abra and spent so long grinding before someone told me you needed to trade to get him.

That lead me to hate the pokémon and like Hypno kind of out of spite and when I got Saphire I found the Ralts line that I loved because no trade BS as I had no friends into the games.

Getting back into Leaf Green and just found an Abra. I can trade now but it just reminds me of that time should I stick with Hypno or give Abra another shot?",1678294615.0

What Even Are The DNA Splicers?,2,11lv5vi,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11lv5vi/what_even_are_the_dna_splicers/,5,"I have no clue what these things are meant to be in-universe. Of course, out of universe, it's your typical McGuffin to allow Kyurem to fuse and explain why it couldn't before but really think about it. What are they? It's a cube that can shape-shift into a long triangular prism that allows Kyurem to unlock the move ""Absofusion"" capable of forcing Reshiram or Zekrom into its body and giving it full control of whichever one and we don't know what it is, whether it's a part of Kyurem that became detached or something, whether it even comes from Kyurem in the first place, whether it was made by someone, why Drayden has it in BW2, how it works, how people discovered it or how people discovered what it does.

I'm reading over the BW2 script and I'm not finding any answers for this. Admittedly, this is an issue with the other McGuffins like the Weather Orbs or the Creation Orbs but at least the fusion items excluding the DNA Splicers were given some explanation. The N-rizers are machines made by Colress to simulate the effects of Necrozma stealing Solgaleo/Lunala's light and the Reins Of Unity are a specially crafted item made for royalty which allows Calyrex to tame its respective steed the same way a human tames a horse. There's a logic there but there isn't really one with the DNA Splicers.

So what's their deal? Are they a part of Kyurem and if so, how did people find them and learn what they do? Or are they man-made and if so, how were they made and why were they made if majority of people didn't think Kyurem was related to the Dragons of Unova at all?",1678278661.0

"Theory of Evolution, not quite what it seems?",1,11lyj1m,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11lyj1m/theory_of_evolution_not_quite_what_it_seems/,3,"So here's what perplexes me greatly, we have pokemon, and we have humans. 

There are references to real world animals, which makes your presume animals that are not pokemon, due exist in the pokemon world. But in the shows, we also see very few examples. Probably because pokemon evolved from these creatures. And we know that Arceus, known as a God level entity, is considered a pokemon as we can capture it's avatars. We also know there are extradimensional aliens, that we can also capture as pokemon, and not just in specialized balls. 

But how long has Arceus been around? We know it was there and exists before the time of Hisui and it's said to have created everything. But what exactly IS a pokemon. Did humans, which as primates, come from the same evolutionary lines as earth humans? Or were they just made as human. Why are humans immune to pokeballs? We even see in Hisui that the pokeballs don't have a human noncapture protocol programmed because tech was not of that level. So humans are fundamentally not pokemon. 

Except...when they are. We see from many examples that people do become pokemon. I.E. most ghost types, which would mean that the possibility of the DNA not being a pokemon, but the human is? There are also examples of humans becoming Kadabras, or even isekai'd into it, like the mystery dungeons.

So what makes a pokemon, what it is, and how did humans rise to power in a world that isn't ours? We do know that Arceus enjoys battles. Like the Eternal Battle Reverie in Legends: Arceus. But humans aren't needed to cause pokemon battles. Like wild creatures, the battles can easily happen between species. And we aren't needed to bring out the potential of a pokemon. Others evolve and grow in power without human interaction. 

But it also comes to the question, we know that Arceus is the pokemon God. But... is he our God?  Did Arceus create humans? That part has always been obscure. Was that intentional? Are we immune to the pokemon affects because humans aren't Arceus' children? But something else's children? Maybe that is why humans have to either die, or be transformed into a pokemon. Bring me your thoughts, sources, and theories.",1678287664.0

I was given a nice surprise when I bought used copies of some 3DS games,4,11lozex,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11lozex/i_was_given_a_nice_surprise_when_i_bought_used/,3,"I tried posting this as an image, but due to screenshots being banned it was taken down, but I get it. I bought a used copy of Alpha Sapphire so I could complete the ORAS national dex, and to my surprise, the national dex was already completed. It had all 721 Pokémon caught. not only that, but I checked the copies of USUM I bought, and they shared the same trainer name as AS. All of them were owned by ""Andrew"". The first time they ran through the Elite four, was way back in on February 5, 2015. Salamance, Blaziken, Manetric, Gyrados, Latias, and Sceptile.   


Now after the shock and excitement cleared, I realized that they had obtained Arceus, which is impossible to my knowledge to obtain in 3DS games, except through the GameStop Promo. It had  an all red Pokeball and an original trainer with the name ""GF"". Now, something that made me wonder if maybe the game had been hacked was that they had 990 masterballs, and several legendaries and mythicals had been caught using the masterball. ""Technically"" you could trade a pokemon with a MB as a held item from one 3ds to another, however the sheer ammount of time that would take is insane and leads me to believe the game was hacked with a homebrewed 3ds or something of the like.

Nonetheless this is still an awesome find considering that i was going to accept not having a few pokemon (such as Arceus) in my dex on the 3ds.",1678258042.0

"Murkrow - Toad's Daily Pokémon Ranking, 198",6,11lmjvs,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11lmjvs/murkrow_toads_daily_pokémon_ranking_198/,1,"[Introducing the first Dark Type Pokémon with no pre-evolution.](https://preview.redd.it/o14nn5vl1gma1.png?width=1437&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c0bf6b9d222d1d7fd6517a6988b1918fbba693dc)

**198: Murkrow**

Surprisingly for the bird girl... I do not actually like Murkrow all that much. I think a huge part of this is how little emphasis the bird puts on it's wings, and it's general scrawny appearance where most of it's body is the head. It looks too much like a bobblehead and too cartoonish for me to take seriously or appreciate the witchy symbolism. The head to body ratio really bugs me waaaaay more than it should, and combined with it's gangly talons and beak and the strange unnatural hat brim, I just can't get behind this creature even if I adore both corvids and witches. 

I do want to compliment the tail though. It's very creative to give it the tuft of a broomstick aesthetic so the hat brim doesn't feel totally isolated. Seeing that I'm totally fine with that hat on Honchkrow though, I think it's just more of a consequence of really disliking Murkrow's head. It's just... it's so cartoony, I can't take it seriously! It doesn't look intimidating due to it's scrawniness and lack of mysticism in it's design, nor is it cute or graceful. It's just kind of... a design.

As harsh as I'm sounding though, I cannot put the concept of a witchy corvid Pokémon down too far - it's a **C Tier** to me. Strong concept, below average execution. As a design, it feels out of place and unfinished, and - oh yeah! It's another Johto single stage that clearly does not look fully evolved. Thankfully we get Honchkrow later - and yeeeeeaaah. I know that's going to be a major hot take. I'm bracing myself already.

For Macargo I think giving it drought would be good. With Stealth rocks it could be an amazing setup pokemon for a lot of teams. I have another idea that is kind of a reach. You see Turbo chargers in cars kind of look like snail shells and they get hot. We know a certain hot snail. So giving it speed boost to reference this might be interesting. I admit this is a reach but still.

Heatmor is weird. I hated him at first but he grew on me. He is a weird Pokemon so I want him to play kind of weird almost wild card like. So hear me out. What if we gave him Moody as a hidden ability. I Moddy can be a bit of a wild card. It's the origin of the god bidoof meme, because a Bidoof stayed alive long enough for moody to enhance it's stats so high it could one shot Arceus. I admit some say Heatmor's stats are to high for Moody. Bibarel has 410 Base stat total and Heatmor has 484, but Heatmore has a worst typing and more limited move pool.  I want a few more Pokemon to have Moody not a lot but a few and dude it's fricken Heatmor. Without looking it up do you even know what this Pokemon looks like ?

In fact if you have a favorite song in Scarlet and Violet most likely he made it himself, from Penny's theme to the Final Boss, Toby really made my Journey through Paldea sound the best it could be, even if the graphics and fps wasn't the greatest.

Should Gamefreak keep having Toby make these bangers for future Pokemon games?! Because for me it's an absolute YES!!!!

So this my list and I think everybody can agree unless you think Terapagos can be another dual type. There is no right or wrong answer. Personally I want Terapagos to be a Fairy/Dragon just because we never had one besides Mega Altaria, but Rock/Psychic makes sense due to Heath connection with Terapagos with the weird dream and Heath don't remember what happened.

I dislike fakemon.,6,11kvgwn,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11kvgwn/i_dislike_fakemon/,6,"
As much as I like Pokémon art, there is one thing about the art community that I dislike, and those are the fakemon and the “redesigns”.

First off, I know how much work goes into making fakemon or creating redesigns, and I don’t want work like that to be discredited, and I’m not saying ALL fakemon designs are bad, I’ve seen a few good ones. However I do have some criticisms about modern fakemon and Pokémon redesigns.

Fakemon tend to be designed to look cool and not unique, and that’s one of the problems I have with Fakemon designs.

I simply find fakemon to be quite bland and devoid of any unique personality except “Rawr I’m an edgy cool over the top monster”, many people say, “Oh this fakemon looks so much better than the Pokémon in the games we have today”, and while that may be true, fakemon AREN’T Pokémon. 

Pokemon are unique due to their balance in design, they aren’t made to look too cool or too cute, they are supposed to look like something that a child can bond with and most importantly they are supposed to be memorable. I can’t recall the many times I’ve seen a thousand fakemon designs on Instagram that were just an over the top edgy dragon/monster thingy. 

A sub category of fakemon that I strongly dislike are the ones who redesign the Pokémon, and at times claim to have “fix” a Pokémon’s design. 

Now I honestly think that the process of redesigning a character sounds like a fun thing to do, technically regional forms and the paradox forms can be considered “redesigns”. However I dislike the way that most artists redesign Pokémon, and it’s the same thing with how they design Fakemon, over the top, edgy, and bland, only except they are putting these qualities on Pokémon already exist. The same goes for artists who do regional forms too, if you count regional forms as redesigns. 

To conclude, I respect the work that goes into making fakemon or redesigning Pokemon, but I simply find most designs are bland and devoid of creativity. 

Dare I say it but part of me gets annoyed seeing artists pumping out the cookie cutter formula of making a generic anime monster and labeling it as a Pokémon, regional/paradox form, or a redesign.",1678184427.0

Datamined next raid event : Decidueye,0,11lgvov,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11lgvov/datamined_next_raid_event_decidueye/,3,"Hello everyone, so it appears to be Decidueye for the next raid event starting on march 13 iirc with the wind tera type.

As well as Greninja, we can't really know which kind of skills Decidueye will have (Special or Physical ?), BUT, knowing Decidueye's skill set, which will be composed of spirit shackle as ghost type, a naturally wind attack and a grass attack with a dark attack and/or set-up moves such as nasty plot/sword dance/double team, and his stats where he has 107 Phy. ATK for 100 Spe. ATK, we can assume that Decidueye will mostly be Physical than Special in his raid.

Considering these facts, and knowing the table type, 2 types should shine against him which are Electric and Ice types.

With these 2 types, and knowing how hard Decidueye will probably hit, we can find that Baxcalibur and Cetitan can be pretty useful Ice tanks (while also dealing strong physical damages to Decidueye as it's physical bulk is pretty low (75)). These two ice pokemon are also quicker than Decidueye (only 70 speed for Decidueye while Baxcalibur hits 87 and Cetitan 73 but can hit even higher with the ability named Slush Rush for Cetitan under snow. Baxcalibur gets a HP Regen with his ability named Ice Body making him more tanky). 

For the electric type, it's pretty hard to find one that will do the job correctly with the list of Pokemon we currently have in S/V, but Miraidon seems to be the most perfect one even though he deals Special damages (Decidueye's Spe Def is at 100 so pretty high).

For the sets I've thought about so far with these 3 Pokemons, here they are :

Miraidon : 
- Taunt
- Parabolic Charge
- Electro Drift
- Reflect/Light Screen/Calm Mind (depends on what you need)

As for the item, I recommend something that will make your Electric terrain last longer, or something that will improve his damages such as life orb or the leftovers if necessary.

Baxcalibur :
- Swords Dance
- Snowscape
- Icicle Crash
- Protect/Substitute (if you want to tank one turn or two to set up) / Rest / Ice Fang 

For the item, pick leftovers if necessary, or either an item that'll last the snow longer or boost your damages. If you used Rest as the last skill, take the mint berry to wake up asap so you don't lose turns.

Cetitan :
- Substitute / Rest / ?
- Bellydrum
- Icicle Crash / Ice Spinner
- Snowscape

Cetitan will definitely need some heal after using Bellydrum which is a bit harsh if you take two consecutive hits from Decidueye under special conditions. Use Sitrus berry if you take Substitute (or Shell Bell, but not really helpful imo). If using Rest, then Mint Berry. If you decide to go all in without Substitute or Rest, then good luck and don't forget to take an item that'll boost your damages !

My Idea for Pokemon moving even after 3DS online gets completely shut down,0,11l2goc,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11l2goc/my_idea_for_pokemon_moving_even_after_3ds_online/,0,"while currently the talks are only about shutting down the eshop, I think it isnt really up to imagination if the 3DS online services get shut down, but rather WHEN.

and obviously this would completely shut down A LOT in terms of transfer.

gen3 to 4 obviously works due to the Dual-Cartridge DSes and 4 to 5 works via a local transfer.

However 5 to 6, 6 to 7, as well as 1/2(VC) to 7, as well as 6/7 to further generations are COMPLETELY blocked is bank inevitably someday shuts down too.

&#x200B;

so my proposal for this dilemma is the following:

One thing I omitted in the Gen4 to 5 description is that it is not purely a plain local transfer (similar how gen1 to 2 worked), but rather the DS with the gen4 game gets a piece of software, the Pokeporter from the gen5 game via DS Download Play (some people may remember that Mario Kart DS similarly allowed multiplayer with several people who dont even own the game).

&#x200B;

This technique also exists for the 3DS, although I have no idea if or how much it was used.

However using this one could equally create a 3DS Download Play software that works similar to the pokeporter to move the pokemon but this time to Pokemon home over a switch or possibly even mobile phone.

If the 3DS even allows installing of software via Download play, one could even go super creative and create a local ""pokemon box"" style system to move pokemon locally between the generations including VC games.",1678203285.0

   * Pheasants have long feathers and Fezandipiti looks like it's attuned to nature.

"Why Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky will always be the most emotional video game in my lifetime, and how replaying it has been one of the most intense experiences I've ever had playing a game.",1,11kytyh,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11kytyh/why_pokemon_mystery_dungeon_explorers_of_sky_will/,0,"Hey Pokemon players so, I just wanted to share something personal relating to the Pokemon games cause it's been weighing heavy on me. I realize there are limitations to what they really let people post on this subreddit but it would mean a lot to me if this post were allowed, and I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it I was in tears just writing this so, hopefully this story touches someones heart <3 This is the story of Me and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky.  


Anyway, so let's go back to summer 2015. I was in love with a woman named Jess whom I'd known since college, and we were both big Pokemon fans. Once we moved in together, we would wake up on days that we had nothing going on (which was quite often haha) and play on our GBA/DS/3DS with the tv in the background for hours before really getting around to doing anything. It was like our daily ritual! It was 1 of the things early on that really connected us, the love of the Pokemon universe.  


So, 1 day I tell Jess I'm about to replay Explorers of Sky for the first time in a few years. I'd only ever played through it completely twice, as it wasn't THAT old of a game. To my surprise, she had never played it! She did play the original on GBA however. So I ended up getting it on my PC to play on the TV so she could watch me play and take turns playing and enjoying the story. Over the next few days, it was amazing to see her reaction to all the cute little things and all the great twists and turns of the plot of Explorers of Sky! I think we played it for about 6 hours a day for a week straight lol. All of the amazing music from the game was probably her favorite part actually. And after we finished, we would still listen to the music through the jukebox occasionally and go back to grind.  


So teleport us to about 5 months later, she went away to see her family but had to stay there due to her father having a serious health issue, and I couldn't be with her for about 3 weeks, including New Years. I had no idea when she was coming back so it was pretty depressing. But when she was gone I did another replay of that game to pass the time, and found myself really sad playing it without her. The music honestly hurt to hear.

  
The next winter,,,, life was good, we had got engaged on Thanksgiving, and 2 days after Christmas we went to get matching tattoos at a friends house. And then someone hit our car. Yeah,,, she died instantly, it obviously was the worst thing that's ever happened to me. I was alone again on New Years, and all I could think about was the music from Explorers of Sky and it just stung bad. So, the whole reason Im writing about this is because I was always afraid to play this game again. But I finally did it.   


My life is pretty good now, I got clean 15 months ago finally, generally am happy, but, if I was ever gonna fully move on I had to play Explorers of Sky again. I was afraid it would be really depressing but, I found myself crying in a good way, with the parts relating to Grovyle and going to the future and back especially, but most of all with the Steam Caves, and Treeshroud Forest music playing. I never cry, I hadn't since 2021 lol but yeah, this game did it. But I feel like I finally can enjoy what may be the best Pokemon game ever, certainly one of my favorite video games ever made. I feel like she was with me the whole time I was playing it and from now on I'll always be grateful to have this game to go back and feel that connection with her, even if she's not here anymore.",1678194260.0

I grown up watching the cartoon when I was a kid but in the past I’ve never had money to buy a gameboy. I’m on my 30s now. A few years ago I finished some classic games in my computer like the Pokémon Red and I enjoyed a lot. 

I recently brought a switch and enjoyed even more finishing Let’s Go Eeve. I also played Pokémon Go for a few years until 2022. 

However playing Pokémon sword in my switch didn’t exactly felt good. Seems like a enormous empty word full of not desirable/weak pokemons.

The many origins of Shiinotic: An overly long analysis of the most underappreciated Alolan Pokémon (tl;dr at the end),1836,11j5m46,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11j5m46/the_many_origins_of_shiinotic_an_overly_long/,93,"Though some may find it forgettable, Shiinotic is my favorite Pokémon of all time, and I'm about to go over all the reasons why through a Reddit post of excruciating length. Alas, Shiinotic is not a very popular Pokémon, and it's easy to see why: a lot of people find it too creepy or uncanny to like, especially compared to Morelull, most of its inspirations aren't immediately obvious, it's never been featured prominently in any of the games, and even in its first appearance it was horribly overshadowed by nearly every other new Grass- and Fairy-type Pokémon. To my knowledge, not one person has ever cared enough about this freaky mushroom-man to write a thorough analysis of its design, its relevance to the Alola region and just why it has the Fairy type... until today.

**Part 1: Mycological Roots**

First, let's take a moment to talk about its heart-meltingly adorable pre-evolution Morelull, an empty-eyed bioluminescent mushroom whose name comes from ""morel"", a famous type of edible fungus, and ""lull"", referring to how its spores can induce sleep; hopefully you haven't been pronouncing it as ""More-lull"". While Morelull may sound innocuous, merely feeding on nutrients from tree roots and soil to sustain itself and never staying in one spot so as not to cause more harm than it needs to, it has potential to be as deadly as any Fairy Pokémon: the Japanese Sun and Moon website speaks of an incident wherein a Morelull colony's spores flew into the vents of an airplane that was flying overhead, putting those on board to sleep and nearly causing a crash!

Shiinotic is best described as ""creepy cute"": it's a taller, more humanoid mushroom with the same hollow eyes as Morelull, but the additions of a blank, off-putting smile and long, green mycelium fingers through which it drains the vitality of seemingly whomever it sees fit, making for one of the more unsettling Fairy-type Pokémon; or, it could be described as a cross between a Toad from Mario and the Landlord from Super Milk Chan. Dangerous as it may be, it's not completely cruel; the anime shows that Shiinotic can also share energy with those they take a liking to, in a similar manner to how mycorrhizal fungi transfer nutrients from the soil to their botanic symbionts. Its name can be broken down into ""shiitake"", a common edible mushroom that grows on decaying wood; ""shine"", referring to its ability to produce phosphorescent light; and ""hypnotic"", referencing the idea of putting one to sleep through hypnotism, the mind-influencing psychoactive agents found within certain mushrooms, and how certain bioluminescent animals beguile prey with their mesmerizing lights.

In most languages, Shiinotic's name pertains to mushrooms and light: in both Japanese and Korean, it is Mashade, and its French name is Lampignon, which reveals that its line also takes inspiration from night lights, lamps and lampshades. The Pokémon Company directly acknowledged this in the promotional artwork for the ""Snorlax's Yawn"" merchandise, which depicts a bedroom filled with all manner of Pokémon-themed furniture, including a Shiinotic bedside lamp situated atop an Aurorus dresser.

Before going into any more detail about what could have inspired Bowling Pin Toad's appearance, it would be wise to first explain its typing. Grass is easy: prior to the revelation that fungi don't actually photosynthesize, they spent ages being conflated with and incorrectly classified as plants. As for Fairy, fairies have been associated with nature, and therefore mushrooms, for almost as long as the idea of fairies has been a thing. Over time, this has lead some lucky 'shrooms to be bestowed with such monikers as ""dryad's saddle"" and ""fairy inkcap"", as well as Shroomish and Breloom being placed in the Fairy Egg Group. During a time when people made less distinction between medical science and magic, the potential medicinal, toxic, or hallucinogenic properties of mushrooms earned them a history of use in ""sorcery"" and shamanic rituals, a trope that still persists in popular culture to this day. In fantasy stories, they're often used as potion ingredients by wizards and witches; funny enough, Shiinotic's design can be read as a literal ""mushroom cloud"" erupting from a cauldron, though it's hard to say whether or not this was deliberate.

The mushroom most frequently depicted in fairy stories and paintings, and arguably the most recognizable fungus of all, is the poisonous and hallucinogenic ***Amanita muscaria***, the red-and-white toadstool commonly known as the fly agaric. You know the one: sometimes it's shown being used as a seat or dwelling by a fairy or gnome, other times it is but one detail in an enchanted forest filled with wonder. It has since been adopted by popular culture as *the* go-to look for a wild mushroom, starting with Renaissance paintings and working its way up through Alice in Wonderland, to The Smurfs, to Mario and Minecraft, to even Pokémon's fifth generation of games, which used it as a basis for Foongus and Amoonguss. Some have also speculated the fly agaric to have religious connotations of varying levels of plausibility, from being the Soma described in ancient Hindu texts, to even being the forbidden fruit consumed by Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.

The *Amanita* genus is best known for its poisonous species, including some of the most toxic toadstools known to man; while some are in fact safe to eat provided they are correctly identified, others contain downright deadly levels of toxins. Though Shiinotic may not be poisonous, lacking the type and only learning one Poison-type move, it shares some of the other trademarks of mushrooms in this genus, including a wide convex cap covered in patches or warts, and a volva - that's the pink, sack-like structure that forms the lower part of Shiinotic's body, a remnant of the universal veil that envelops the mushroom during its infancy.

In addition to *Amanita*, Shiinotic is based on ***Mycena*** fungi, of which 59 species are known to produce **fairy fire**. Fairy fire is one of the three names for the ethereal glow produced by chemical reactions within certain fungi on decaying wood, the others being foxfire and chimpanzee fire. In particular, Shiinotic's pink cap is reminiscent of species such as *M. rosella*, *M. pura* and *M. purpureofusca*; if we branch out to other families, an even closer match is the Pink Waxcap, *Porpolomopsis calyptriformis*. While foxfire-producing fungi mainly emit it from the mycelium, the fruitbody, or both, the slippery mycena (*Roridomyces roridus*) specifically only has bioluminescent spores. The anime shows that this isn't true of Morelull nor Shiinotic, but nevertheless their Pokédex entries mainly describe their light as being emitted from their spores; likewise, *M. pruinosoviscida* is known to emit light from both fruitbody and spores. Other *Mycena* species that may hold relevance here include *M. interrupta* and *M. nargan*, also known as the pixies' parasol and the spotted pixie cap respectively; as well as several species that go by variations of ""fairy helmet"", such as the bleeding fairy helmet (*M. haematopus*).

All of this is, of course, a perfect fit for Alola: bioluminescent fungi are most common in temperate and tropical climates, and Hawaii is known as the Rainbow State (hence Team Rainbow Rocket, the Prism Pokémon Necrozma, Minior's many colors and the bedazzling Bruxish). Hawaii is home to many species capable of producing light - mostly aquatic animals and bacteria, but also the fungus ***Armillaria nabsnona***, whose mycelium is bioluminescent. In general, *Armillaria* are better known as honey fungi, for many of their species have yellow, yellowish-brown or straight-up brown caps that match up with shiny Shiinotic's, such as *A. ostoyae*, *A. luteobubalina* and *A. mellea*.

Honey fungi are an example of a facultative parasite: they grow in the roots of living trees and eventually kill them, but they've adapted to eat both living and dead organic matter - they'll continue to feed on their host even after it perishes, regardless of whether it was actually the fungus that did it in. While Shiinotic's signature move, Strength Sap, is obviously based on how fungi ""sap"" nutrients from their environment through their mycelia, the fact that it drains opponents of their strength yet gives them nothing in return brings to mind parasitic fungi which derive all of their nutrients from their hosts, such as honey fungi. Shiinotic's default color scheme also gives it the most ""psychedelic"" vibe of all fungal Pokémon, which may not be entirely a coincidence: on top of its fly agaric inspiration, magic mushrooms - yes, the ones with hallucinogenic alkaloids - mainly occur in the tropics and subtropics, including Hawaii, where you may come across *Panaeolus bisporus* and *Panaeolus cambodginiensis*.

Yet another potential mycological reference lies in Hachijō-jima, the southernmost of Tokyo's Izu islands. From the end of World War II through the end of the 1960s, the government made efforts to promote it as the ""**Hawaii of Japan**"" to increase investment and property development. It just so happens that multiple species of *Mycena* fungus known to emit a pale green light are abdundant on this island, including *M. chlorophos*, *M. pruinosoviscida*, and *M. lux-coeli*, the last of which was long considered to be endemic to Hachijō-jima until it was found on other Japanese islands decades later.

**Part 2: Mythological Roots**

As mentioned previously, shiny Shiinotic takes its color scheme from various honey fungi, making it the second Pokémon inspired by a parasitic fungus. The first was Parasect, and these two are linked in more ways than just sharing the same base stat total and evolution level: in Pokémon Sun, the Pokémon that attacks when you collect the Tiny Mushroom for the Lush Jungle trial is a Parasect, whereas in Pokémon Moon it is a Shiinotic. In Alola, Paras can only be found during the day, while Morelull is a night-only encounter. The cherry on top is this Shiinotic Pokédex entry:

>Ultra Moon: When it starts fighting for territory with Parasect, the entire area gets completely coated in spores!

Paras only appearing during the day is accurate to real cicadas, most of which are diurnal, but what about Morelull? Well, fairies in general have long been thought to come out exclusively or more often at night, including and up to the **Menehune**, a seldom-seen race of forest-dwellers spoken of in Hawaiian mythology. Though considered fairies, Menehune have more in common with dwarves, including their short, stocky build and exceptional craftsmanship. According to legend, the Menehune reside deep within the mountain forests and caves of Hawaii, away from any human civilization; stand at about 2–3 feet tall, barely shorter than Shiinotic (3'03""); and only be active at night, during which time they would establish fantastic fish ponds, roads, houses and temples. They've been credited with building some of Hawaii's finest ancient architecture before even the first Polynesian settlers arrived there.

In contemporary Hawaii, the term ""Menehune rings"" is sometimes used to refer to **fairy rings**, perfect circles of mushrooms which can cause rings of grass around them to either grow taller or wither and darken, depending on the fungus (ironically, these necrotic zones are the exact thing Morelull does its best to avoid creating). It's certainly no coincidence that three of the fungi able to grow in fairy rings are in the *Amanita* genus, which Shiinotic is already known to draw inspiration from. Even outside of Hawaii, fairy rings lend their name to the vast folklore surrounding them. Let's take a look at some more Pokédex entries:

>Sun: Forests where Shiinotic live are treacherous to enter at night. People confused by its strange lights can never find their way home again.

>Moon: It emits flickering spores that cause drowsiness. When its prey succumb to sleep, this Pokémon feeds on them by sucking in their energy.

>Sword: Its flickering spores lure in prey and put them to sleep. Once this Pokémon has its prey snoozing, it drains their vitality with its fingertips.

>Shield: If you see a light deep in a forest at night, don't go near. Shiinotic will make you fall fast asleep.

This is bog-standard fairy behavior. Many mythological fairies such as redcaps, boggarts, dullahans, rusalki and the nuckelavee were *highly* dangerous to those they crossed paths with; others were said to be or utilize will-o'-the-wisps - known in Welsh folklore as **fairy fire** - which would entrance or bewilder travelers who saw them at night. To reiterate, Shiinotic's territory is generally *not* worth the risk of encroaching on when it's dark out, just as European folktales would often warn not to step in fairy rings.

Since science hadn't yet advanced enough to disprove it, the appearance of fairy rings was attributed to supernatural beings such as elves, witches or fairies dancing in circles, and could be a sign of either good or bad luck depending on the tradition. At worst, consequences for entering them could range from being transported to the realm of the fae, to unwillingly joining in on the nightly dances until your body gives out. Legends would often paint them as being all but impossible to escape from on one's own, and since time was said to pass differently in the otherworld, your trip to Fairyland could have equated to weeks or even years elapsed in the mortal realm, potentially resulting in a near-instant death from old age after breaking free. The only way to safely investigate a fairy ring was to run around it nine times, specifically under the full moon according to a Northumberland tradition. Other creatures said to be linked to fairy rings include dragons, giant bug-eyed toads, and even the Devil himself.

At this point, you may have remembered that fairy rings are not the only mysterious circles associated with night and the paranormal. One could say that **crop circles** are the contemporary equivalent of fairy rings, even if they aren't created naturally. In some ways, aliens are the spiritual successors to traditional fairies in today's popular culture and urban legends, sharing their unknowability, alien morals, and knack for abducting random people or livestock at night without a thought only to bring them back different, sometimes with no memory of what occurred when they were kidnapped. Fairies have enough parallels to aliens that they would fall under the infamous ""ancient astronauts"" conspiracy theory, which implies that mythological beings such as gods, angels and the fair folk themselves were in fact aliens who visited Earth long ago. Another discredited theory linking the two is the ""interdimensional hypothesis"", which says that sightings and legends of beings such as ghosts, fairies and UFOs are really cover-ups for visitors from parallel realities or dimensions.

One of the most common perpetrators of alleged alien abductions are the classic **Gray Aliens**, which Shiinotic lines up with surprisingly well. The Illuminating Pokémon shares the archetypal Grays' pitch-black eyes and short stature compared to humans; it has (hyp)notic in its name, potentially referencing the alien brainwashing trope; and its huge, dome-shaped cap could very well symbolize either an enlarged brain or a flying saucer from which an alien may descend upon Earthlings, or use a tractor beam to do the inverse. Aliens being associated with light is nothing new, either. Some of the very first UFO sightings of the 20th century described them as fiery balls of light in the sky; for somewhat more recent examples, just look at E.T.'s glowing finger, or the scene from Close Encounters of the Third Kind in which colored lights are used to communicate with the extraterrestrial mothership.

This is all too perfect for games titled Sun and Moon: not only are they literally named after celestial bodies, but they also introduced the Light Trio, the astronaut-like Dewpider, the miniature meteor Minior, the extradimensional aliens called the Ultra Beasts, and the seemingly alien NPC in Haina Desert who ""returns to space"" after being shown a Solrock/Lunatone. Moreover, Hawaii has had problems with alien (as in non-native) species for centuries, just not the extraterrestrial kind. Yungoos is based on invasive mongooses that were introduced to Hawaii to control the population of imported rats; the Ultra Beasts are extradimensional beings that are used to wildly different environments from Alola, making them too dangerous to belong there, and Shigeru Ohmori confirmed this to be what the Ultra Beasts symbolize in the first place.

Though there are a couple fungi that are invasive to Hawaii, none seem like they could have inspired Shiinotic. If its creation was influenced by any invasive fungus in particular, it would likely be *Saproamanita inopinata*, one of the two species of *Saproamanita* agaric considered to be invasive by the time Sun and Moon would have started development. *Saproamanita* are in the same family as *Amanita* and were once considered to be the same genus; some species can even grow in fairy rings. *S. inopinata* has not been observed in Hawaii, but rather New Zealand, which has also struggled with invasive species, starting with dogs and rats introduced by Polynesian settlers. This would still fit Alola because some facets of the region were in fact inspired by other Oceanian islands, most notably Komala.

Going back to mythology, there's one last legendary creature that could hold relevance to Shiinotic, and if you're a Studio Ghibli fan, you may have already guessed what it is: the **kodama**, literally meaning ""tree spirit"" in Japanese. Kodama are a kind of nature deity, said to be the animated souls of the ancient trees they inhabit; the few reported sightings of kodama describe them as faint wisps or orbs of light, or as lights with tiny humanoids inside them. The Ghibli movie Princess Mononoke has what is by leaps and bounds the most famous portrayal of kodama, depicting them with entirely white skin and black dots for eyes and mouths. Pokémon is no stranger to referencing other modern media (case in point: Lokix and Baxcalibur; even the very foundation of the franchise, Poké Balls, are an Ultraman reference) so I could totally believe that the Ghibli kodama had an influence on Shiinotic's design.

**The Verdict**

Well, that's pretty much it. In conclusion, Shiinotic is one of the most inspired, well-thought out Pokémon that Generation VII has to offer, tying together a multitude of mycological and mythological references from Europe, Hawaii and Japan alike into an original forest sprite that wouldn't feel out of place in any number of fairy stories, yet also manages to remind us of more modern analogues of the fair folk. Taking into account all these different origins, it's hard to find a Pokémon more deserving of the Fairy type than Shiinotic.

**Tl;dr:** Shiinotic's potential inspirations include lamps and lampshades; mushrooms' folkloric ties to fairies and magic; a literal ""mushroom cloud"" erupting from a witch's cauldron; various fungi of the *Amanita*, *Mycena*, *Porpolomopsis*, *Armillaria* and *Saproamanita* genera, some of which produce fairy fire; Parasect, serving as its nocturnal counterpart and rival; nocturnal Hawaiian fairies known as Menehune; fairy rings, also known as Menehune rings; the double meaning of ""fairy fire"", referring to both will-o'-the-wisps and fungal bioluminescence; Gray Aliens and UFOs; and kodama, specifically the ones from Princess Mononoke.",1678039497.0

[Rebuild Tuesday] Electivire,4,11kjh3j,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11kjh3j/rebuild_tuesday_electivire/,6,"Hey Trainers!

Welcome to this week's edition of Rebuild Tuesday, a weekly event we're doing along with our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pokemon)!

This week's Pokémon is **Electivire**!

**#466 Electivire** (Japanese エレキブル)

*Thunderbolt Pokémon*

*It pushes the tips of its two tails against the foe, then lets loose with over 20,000 volts of electricity.*

**Electivire's Base Stats:**

* **HP:75** 
* **Attack:123** 
* **Defense:67** 
* **Sp. Attack:95** 
* **Sp. Defense: 85** 
* **Speed:95**

**Introduction:**

Hey trainers, Welcome back to Rebuild Tuesday! This week we are going to be looking at Electivire, a mon who has had a very sad, gradual fall from grace. Debuting in Diamond and Pearl this 123 attack monster was in OU; moving down a tier with each generation it now finds itself in PU. It’s mediocre speed of 95 and terrible bulk makes it highly prone to being revenge-killed.
Motor Drive allows Electivire to increase its negligible speed and provides immunity to electric moves, which it already resists. Vital Spirit means that it is immune to sleep. It is outclassed by stronger electric types such as rotom and its poor move pool leaves it walled out by many common walls such as mudsdale.
How would you change Electivire so that it can become viable despite the aforementioned weaknesses. Does terastallizing improve the viability of Electivire? How would you rebuild Electivire to be viable in either SV given DLC or SwSH where it is currently available?

**How viable do you trainers think Electivire is? Is there anything else you think it needs in order to be a good competitive Pokémon (e.g. new moves, stats, abilities or typings)? What is its most optimal set?**

"Espeon & Umbreon - Toad's Daily Pokémon Ranking, 196 & 197",4,11kiqw0,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11kiqw0/espeon_umbreon_toads_daily_pokémon_ranking_196_197/,7,"[Introducing the first Pokémon to expand a family beyond four Pokémon ](https://preview.redd.it/rl13ufrqf7ma1.png?width=1437&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=12e66dfa149d6a25e6beab66bc338046b3dfddee)

**196: Espeon**

Another Eeveelution! And I've got to say, Johto's Eeveelutions are of extremely high quality. Not that bad Eeveelutions exist, they do not, but Espeon and Umbreon as a duo feel absolutely fantastic in the way they contrast each other. They both have very similar vibes of mystical power beyond mortal comprehension, combined in a package that is both abstract yet absolutely adorable, maintaining the creative chimera like elements of Eevee's design.

Between the two of the however, Espeon is the simpler design by far with a body that can arguably be accused of falling into the Gen 1 monochromatic body problem, which while not a deal breaker for me on a Pokémon this small, does detract from it. But it's elegance is communicated instead by it's shape, two tails, and the gem on it's forehead. It's effectively what Alolan Meowth would kill to be, an actual graceful and superior feline.

Compared to the Kantonian Eeveelutions, I think Espeon ends up pretty close to Vaporeon. The latter design feels more cohesive to me, with more creative elements, but I can't shake my love of Espeon's beautiful vibes. While Vaporeon edges it out, they both stand among the best Eeveelutions in y eyes in the **A+ Tier**. 

[Fanart by the appropriately named Espeongirl360](https://preview.redd.it/17ulrb3bh7ma1.jpg?width=430&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=13712bd88d10ae03c6b6fb3b8e9e1198bfe84f43)

&#x200B;

**197: Umbreon**

In case it wasn't clear by now, I'm a huge fan of Eevee and it's evolutions. And here we arrive at my absolute favorite out of all of Eevee's evolutions, my favorite Pokemon in all of Johto (and Kanto), and my 13th favorite Pokémon prior to Gen 9. I share that last piece of trivia because man does it feel fitting that the black cat is the unlucky number. 

But Umbreon honestly feels perfect to me. I'm a huge fan of black cats with emboldened yellow eyes, and definitely a cat girl in real life. Not to say that the Eevees are cats, they're chimeras with elements of dogs and rabbits mixed in, but that only enhances the appeal. More over, Umbreon does an excellent visual balance in putting more yellow lunar symbols across it's body to break up the monotony of black fur, in a way that both looks really intimidating and aesthetically pleasing at once. 

Umbreon feels like a masterclass balancing act of preserving cuteness, power, and elegance in one simple and cohesive design, and I love it a lot. It strikes at so many trends I like in Pokémon, and I'm not surprised that it's my favorite Pokémon discussed in the series so far. Also, I don't talk about shinies much, but it's shiny is BLUE and it looks BEAUTIFUL, I love the color blue and the way it glows and contrasts with the - aaaaaaaa! ...man I recognize that yellow is objectively more symbolic but if Umbreon used the shiny palate it probably would be S Tier for me.

You might find it strange that nearly two hundred posts into the series and after all this gushing about Umbreon being my favorite so far, that I don't rank Umbreon in the S Tier yet. Sorry, that's a very exclusive club - there were only 7 S-Tier Pokémon before Gen 9. There's probably still not that many, even if that's my favorite Generation. I like to keep my list of absolute favorites very narrow. Umbreon IS, however, the very top of the **A+ Tier** so far, a position more than deserved. I love this thing!

**Postscript:**

Okay side note. Y'know how Vaporeon has the reputation for furry bait...? Uh, looking up fanart for Umbreon was WAAAAAY harder than Vaporeon, there were a lot of humanoid hot Umbreons. Just a weird observation. 

Also, I'm really behind, sorry. School's been tough. I have been keeping track of where I'm supposed to be though - yesterday was intended to be Murkrow and today Slowking. I'll probably get everything caught up through Misdreavus by tomorrow, just in time for the big 200.

Do you ever sometimes feel Pokemon would've looked better if it stayed 2D Pixel Art?,19,11jz9ew,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11jz9ew/do_you_ever_sometimes_feel_pokemon_wouldve_looked/,20,"There's nothing inherently wrong with 3D or anything.  But the problem is, I still don't think GameFreak has properly embraced the extra dimension.  I'll start off by saying the problems that they've been having in 3D.

To begin with, there's this concept of [Uncanny Valley.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley)  Ever since Pokemon has been 3D by the mainline games, since X and Y, they've entered this, and never left it.  Here are some examples why.

* **They continue to use the 3D Models in the same manner as they have their 2D sprites in battle, and it doesn't work in 3D**:  In the 2D games, the battlefield was an abstraction.  We don't see how much actual distance there is between the battling mon, they're just attacking on circular disc stages, and our mind is able to fill in the gap of what happens between easier as a result.  When a mon uses Tackle and nudges the air on their circle, we can easily imagine them running across X distance to actually ram into the opponent.  However, in 3D space, this no longer works.  We can see exactly how much physical distance there is between the mon.  So, staying on one side of the battlefield and nudging the air here is one of the examples of the games still being in Uncanny Valley since it went 3D.
* **They haven't filled in the gaps that 3D requires to be filled in with NPCs**:  This is most apparently seen in the remakes of once 2D games, like BDSP.  Characters still behave in a very stiff, unnatural (and thus Uncanny Valley) manner in the 3D space, like walking on a grid, but not moving diagonally, so they only ever do 90 degree turns.  It's entirely possible to have diagonal and smoother movement, while still being on a grid.  Just take a look at RuneScape, or even in 2D games, Lufia:  The Ruins of Lore also has smooth movement on a grid.  Also, when it comes to cutscenes, we still have lots of things being implied to have happened, rather than being shown, which is more awkward in 3D.  For example, rival Barry bumping into the player; in the old 2D Gen 4 games, the characters are very stoic and don't budge an inch.  It was possible to have the player be nudged and shake, or even get pushed back a tile, but it's still easier to accept just a textbox ""THUD!"" in this abstraction.  However, in a 3D space, that same sort of stoic reaction to that situation once again comes across as Uncanny Valley.  The characters don't lose balance, or get knocked over, or anything, so it really does just come across as far too stiff in 3D.
* **The disconnect between characters moving their mouths, but having no voice acting**:  This is made worse when the cameras are up close to their face in the 3D games too, like Sword and Shield's intro being right up in Rose's face as he flails his arms and shouts about, but not a single peep is heard out of him.  Or how Piers is doing a whole concert at his gym, but all we hear are clothes ruffling and foot tapping sounds.  I believe even Black and White 2 had something more than this for Roxie.  With the 2D games, we never saw their mouths moving to begin with, due to how low-res the pixel art was, but even if we did, I think it'd be easier to accept this in 2D rather than 3D.
* **The colours of the characters and mon aren't as vibrant as the 2D sprites**:  This is more apparent if you directly compare the models with their 2D sprite counterparts from the older games.  Charizard is a less vibrant orange and looks washed out, Blastoise is a less vibrant blue, etc.

Now of course, this isn't to say they haven't had some good things in 3D.  Some of the new signature moves, like Cinderace's ability, do get lots of dynamism from the camera moving around and dynamic angles.  But the question ends up being, is it worth it, when everything else suffers.

Next I want to talk about an example of what Pokemon could still be if it stayed 2D.

My thought is, it could've gone higher resolution with the pixel art, and given us more detailed sprites and worlds.  The DS era saw them hybridizing 2D and 3D, with the characters being 2D sprites, and the environments being 3D.   I think that could've kept going, but the pixel art would've needed to go higher resolution, to match the smoothness of the polygons at higher resolutions.  There's an artist on DeviantArt named [SassySnivy](https://www.deviantart.com/speedxaaa), who sometimes does higher-res remakes of the old 2D Pokemon sprites, and it looks gorgeous!  I think it's an example of how Pokemon could've looked, if it stayed 2D Pixel art.  Here are some examples of their work below!

Two theories about The Treasure of Area Zero DLC,2,11k5opn,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11k5opn/two_theories_about_the_treasure_of_area_zero_dlc/,9,"After a disappointing direct, I tried to collect all of the few informations available about the upcoming DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, so I formulated two theories about its narrative contents.

**The Teal Mask**. In the first part of the DLC, we're going to visit Kitakami and we're going meet new characters and Pokémon. Despite many people think otherwise, this first part of the DLC is strongly connected to the second one and the whole story: the new Pokémon Ogerpon is affected by Terastal even though it lives really far from Paldea. Then, there are two new important characters we're going to bring with us: Carmine and Kieran. 
Carmine is a little bit selfish, determined and hostile to people of other ethnic groups, like us. In spite of this, she has a soft spot for her little brother Kieran, who is shy and gentle.  
The three new Legendary Pokémon Okidogi, Munkidogi and Fezandipiti that protect the country from fiends and vicious beasts are based on the fairytale which inspired Tajiri for the creation of the three starters: Momotaro. 
Momotaro was a boy that was born from a peach that was found by an old lady. When he was old enough, but still a child, he gone on a battle against demons (Oni). He met three companions: a dog, a monkey and a feazant. 
Even in the trailer, we see a child with the Legendary Pokémon chasing off the fearsome Ogerpon. 
In nearly all cultures, the child is a symbol of youth, hope and humbleness. In many folklore fairytales (like Momotaro) the child that battles against monsters is seen as a growth opportunity. 
In ancient Arcadia, a Greek region, at the end of spring, sheperds thought to protect their flocks with newborn lambs from wolves' attacks by sending away someone who eaten the entrails of a sacrificed child away. We don't know if, for example, the child's blood was used to sprinkle the sheep and the lambs' barn so that wolves knew that there were humans (whom they fear) nearby, but the sense stays the same: sacrificing something,  someone important to *protect* one's resources. 
In Mesoamerican cultures, young victims of sacrifices were divinized.
If the hero of this Pokémon Momotaro was just Kievan?  In that case, he will step up with our help to fight against the malevolent presence of Ogerpon, the Pokémon buffed by Terastal. Thanks to him, Carmen will open to us.
 

**The Indigo Disk**. In the second part of the DLC, Arven, Nemona and Penny are probably going to return: you need to finish the main story to play it. You are going to study in Blueberry Academia, which bears a significant resemblance to Atlantis. Atlantis is the codename of Area Zero. Terapagos also is similar to this structure. In the form that they shown to us, Terapagos's silhouette looks like Paldea. The leaker Riddler Khu shown a picture of the movie King of Thorn. 
It is about humanity struggling against a virus which turns bodies to stone. Later on, it's discovered that this virus never existed, but a creature that fell from a meteor in Siberia called Medusa, who can make wishes come true, generated it. The whole DLC's codegame is ""Sudochi"". It isn't the fruit, but an asteroid. It seems that in this DLC we're going to uncover the true nature of Paldea's geological history. It looks like it's inspired also by the most ancient version of the World Turtle's myth, in which the turtle was the world. Will we face Terapagos in its true colors? Why has it got this form?

Which Pseudo Legendaries are actually usable in a play through?,1,11kh0b4,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11kh0b4/which_pseudo_legendaries_are_actually_usable_in_a/,6,"When I was playing Scarlet, I picked up a Gibble fairly early on, and was able to fully evolve it into Garchomp before the end of the game, and thinking about it, it was the first time I was actually able to incorporate a pseduo into my team just playing normally.

Looking into it, I don't think there's many that you actually could use in a game , Even with the others you can obtain early  on in S/V, like Deino and Dreepy, they don't evolve to lvl 50, so you'll be weighed down by them a lot till just before the end game.

It seems like the majority of them are introduced way late into their debut game for you to be able to add them to  a team without major effort, and even if you could get a hold of them, a good few have absurdly high levels just to reach their mid stage. Granted, they do become very powerful at the final stage, but its a bit inconsistant how Beldum and Gibble evolve at lvl 20 and 24 respectively, the avergae seems to be 30, but then Dreep and Deino evolve at 50.

It seems the only viable options that don't hinder you for most the game are Garchomp and Metagross, since you could get gibble/gabite fairly early in S/M+ S/V and Beldum in S/M. Anyone else been able to use any other pseudos without causing pain?",1678143315.0

A Deep Dive into the Origins of Ting-Lu (tl;dr at the end),3,11jzo76,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11jzo76/a_deep_dive_into_the_origins_of_tinglu_tldr_at/,0,"This will likely be the first of 4 posts, each detailing the origins of each member of the Treasure of Ruins. Yes, I know this is out of order. No, I don't care because Ting-Lu is my favorite and I will die on this hill.

First up, etymology. Ting-Lu's name is very straightforward, being the Wade-Giles romanization of its Chinese name, 鼎鹿. 鼎 refers to the cauldron on its head, while 鹿 means deer.

Out of the two, the more interesting one is the Cauldron. In ancient China, these cauldrons were originally used for cooking, but later developed into religious vessels of sacrifice and then eventually symbols of imperial authority. The green-ish color indicates that it is likely made up bronze, as most cauldrons were, though interestingly it has a round bottom and 3 legs, as opposed to a square bottom and 4 legs that were used by those of higher authority. One possible explanation is that the cauldron was made very early on, before the invention of the 4-legged cauldrons, when cauldrons were made almost exclusively by nobles and for them to show their power. The age of the cauldron is fitting, as Ting-Lu is the accumulated fear of people over thousands of years, which I will go over later.

Regarding their symbolism, Legend goes that an ancient king once ordered to make 9 massive cauldrons for 9 of its regions to celebrate the kingdom's wealth and engrave the kingdom's wisdom on it for future generations. They were so large that it took millions of people months to move them to the capital city once they were built. Over the years, as kingdoms were overthrown and capitals moved from place to place, the new kings would move the cauldrons with them, symbolizing the seize of political power. A person asking about the quality of the cauldrons were a direct indication that they would want to seize power. All 9 cauldrons were eventually lost.

Now that we understand the cauldron, why deer? My favorite answer is that this is a massive reference to the book *The Deer and the Cauldron* by Jin Yong (Louis Cha). Jin Yong was one of the most influential  writers in Chinese history who wrote almost exclusively in the Wuxia genre, which is mixture between historical fiction, fantasy, drama, and lots of martial arts. His books are characterized by rich references to traditional Chinese culture and values, combining factual history with mystical powers that roughly follow Chinese philosophy. *The Deer and the Cauldron* is his last Wuxia novel, and is the most unique of them all; instead of a traditional hero, the protagonist is a lazy and rebellious anti-hero with no knowledge of martial arts, akin to the Dark type in Pokemon. During his journey, he made friends with the “Heaven and Earth society”, a secret society aiming to overthrow the Qing dynasty and became their spy in the palace. Through wit, deception, and sheer luck, he became a powerful figure in the government known as the “Duke of Deer Cauldron”, assisting both the emperor and his underground friends. However, the emperor eventually found out about his falsity, and forced him to either remain loyal to the palace and kill the society, or be exiled and outcast forever. He chose the latter, bringing his entire wealth and 7 wives to a remote land in the South, never to be found again.

How does this relate to Ting-Lu? In the story, the cauldron symbolizes a king’s desire to seize absolute authority, while the deer symbolizes the common people helplessness to fight back. Together, they represent the struggles of Chinese (Han) people against the Manchu-led Qing dynasty. This coincides with how the cauldron in Ting-Lu is broken: the ancient Chinese rituals are replaced with foreign ones, breaking the traditional norms. It also explains the dex entries. In Scarlet, Ting-Lu is revealed to be the embodiment of fear, alluding to how Ancient Chinese history is one of many dynasties, each one ending violently either by a tyrant or an invader, each time bringing along great chaos that causes mass fear and panic. For Violet, Ting-Lu bringing its head to the ground can be seen as a metaphor for a dynasty crumbling, splitting the country into dozens of fragments just as how Ting-Lu splits the earth. Ting-Lu is the embodiment of the common people's fear of the upper-class authority of the government.

Finally, let's take a look at how the rest of this Pokemon supports my theory. Ting-Lu's ability, Vessel of Ruin, lowers special attack, just as how the iron grip of a strong authority restricts minds and willpower. The Dark type is self-evident, while the Ground type likely refers to land and the importance of land in political control. In Ancient Chinese philosophy, people reside on the ground and the gods reside in heaven (literally 'sky'). Control over land is direct control over political power, especially since Ancient China was very much an agricultural society, where people lived in farms and rarely moved beyond. Land is the people's home, and thus changes in Land, either politically or physically, results in massive fear of the unknown future as people could no longer sustain themselves with what was passed on by their elders. The emphasis on 'homeland' is a large part of Chinese values, as is patriotism. Another interpretation is that Ground is ancient and steady, like the rule of a powerful authority. This can be seen on Ting-Lu's body, where clear layers can be seen like those of mountains or sedimentary rock, even building up a mountain at the top. These layers can only be formed over long periods of time, where different climates creates different layers that build up on top of one another. Ting-Lu's chin also has what looks like to be stalactites, which can also only be formed over long periods of time. 

TL;DR: Ting-Lu references a famous novel of the Wuxia genre, where the cauldron and the deer symbolize the greed for power and the commoners' fear and helplessness in face of violence and chaos caused by those with authority.",1678111131.0

[Hot Take]Old Pokémon Games aren't better than current ones,0,11k9i09,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11k9i09/hot_takeold_pokémon_games_arent_better_than/,20,"I've been playing Pokémon since the first gen, obviously, I was very young when I started so naturally, I have some nostalgic feelings for the older games, especially gen 3/4.

Now, I started playing Pokémon Heartgold again to have a savestate I could shiny hunt on. 50h in and I'm at the Indigo Plateau, and I'm struggling hard.

I've already caught Ho-Oh and if not for it, I wouldn't get past the first Trainer. You are incredibly underleveled if you don't grind before every single gym, ESPECIALLY if you switch pokémon here and there, because apparently Pokémon you catch in the Wild have to be 10lvl under the Trainer average. So either keep the same team from the start or have fun grinding.

You see my main complaint with this game yet? It's not that it's hard, it's just boring. I'm gonna have to continue putting time into grinding my pokémon up to Level 50 just for me to make it through the Elite 4. There's no skill involved in grinding. IDK why people constantly bring up old games like they weren't incredibly flawed too?

&#x200B;

My current team consists of:

Dratini Lvl 25

&#x200B;

Lapras Lvl 25

&#x200B;

Rhyhorn Lvl 35

&#x200B;

Gyrados Lvl 39

&#x200B;

Feraligatr lvl 40

&#x200B;

And Ho-Oh Lvl 55.

&#x200B;

Sure, the Difficulty in modern Pokémon games feels lacking, but isn't that because we all know all they types and weaknesses now? I can absolutely see why GameFreak / Pokémon doesn't listen to their fans that much, because we are absolutely biased towards the arguably worst games of the series.

&#x200B;

And I so far, without using medical items, I've only managed to get to the third trainer. And Barely so.

I'm seriously considering just stopping and putting the game away, since this already took a ridiculous amount of time to have half of the game through and now struggling this hard.",1678127876.0
What other possible ancestors would you like to see in a potential Legends: Arceus Sequel? (Possible Spoilers?),106,11j1xa2,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11j1xa2/what_other_possible_ancestors_would_you_like_to/,44,"Something that I want to discuss in PLA's anniversery a while back. The title is pretty self explanatory: What other potential ancestors would you guys like to see in another Legends game?

One ancestor I would like to see is one for [Viola](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Viola). Perhaps they love to draw or take pictures (depending on how long ago the game would take place) of various Pokemon they had spotted - And could even give the player a photo of a rare Pokemon.

[Koga](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Koga) is another charater I want to see a potential ancestor of, given that Beni mentioned the ancient ways on the ninja. It would be nice to see another ninja character in the past who has more connections to a contemporary ninja character.

A character based on [Silver](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Silver_(game)) would also be interesting, though their teams would not take inspiration from Silver's. Instead I imagine such a character using mainly Ground types, like Dugtrio and Rhydon, as a callback to Giovanni, and highlight his relation to Silver. They might even be seen starting what would later become Team Rocket.

I would also like to see a [Cara Liss](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Cara_Liss) ancestor in the less distant past, where they recently invented fossil resurrection. Unfortunately, they would have a *lot* of misunderstandings on their craft, resulting in previous fossil Pokemon gaining... less than ideal new forms (by anatomical standards).

My final idea for a Legends character isn't an ancestor, but I still want to include her here: I want to see [Liza](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Tate_and_Liza) get the Ingo treatment and be sent back to the past with no memories. (After all, the distortions separated one set of twins, so why not another >:)) I like to imagine that version of Liza being discovered by some friendly bamboo harvesters one night, who then take her in as their own. She would also end up in a position of high power - not exactly a princess, more like one of PLA's Wardens. And she would be seen outside on nights with a cresent moon, shedding tears as if she was reminiscing an forgotten friend from long ago...

But what about you guys? What other characters would you like to see in another Legends title?",1678035267.0

I recently started playing SoulSilver for the first time ever. I played Silver and Crystal to death as a kid so am pretty familiar with most mechanics in the game. However, I am wondering if there's a way to ""guarantee"" getting a Leafstone before facing the Elite Four? I know Picnicker Gina will call you if she finds one, but I first registered her number around 3 hours into my game, and I am currently 18 hours in. In Silver/Crystal, the amount of calls you would receive from in-game people was pre-determined. So if I deleted all phone numbers except for Gina/Allen/Tully, it was guaranteed I would get a stone of my choosing sooner rather later. I have looked through the pokegear and don't see any way to get rid of numbers. I have not accepted any phone numbers from people other than the ""stone givers"" and the numbers that the game makes you take. Can I delete Lyra/Daycare man, etc numbers? Is there something I should be doing that I'm not? Or is this just a very intense waiting game?",1678125092.0

"Instead of BOTW, I wish Pokemon was more like Yakuza.",17,11jlhwc,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11jlhwc/instead_of_botw_i_wish_pokemon_was_more_like/,22,"As a player who is disappointed with SV but really enjoyed PLA, I think a modern Pokemon game's single player would be stronger if it emphasized side quests that help expand the game's world. Not that BOTW doesn't do that, but when we hear BOTW the assumption is ""wide open sandbox, non-linear progression."" 

The Yakuza series is famous for its involved side quests, both for comedic purposes but also delivering some pretty impactful side stories as well. I was thinking of PLA and getting side quests that featured Pokemon and humans being brought together, and that helping establish the modern-day relationships of Pokemon and people. Little side stories would really go a long way to add content to these empty cities/towns, and help flesh out the people of the region.

I'll probably get blasted by the SV community, but I just feel like these games failed ""BOTW Pokemon"" experience people expected, playing in this big empty sandbox without the tools and toys of a Zelda game. Hyrule is a setting 100 years after a near apocalyptic event, yet it feels more alive than Paldea.

Volcarona and drought,0,11kdmt1,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11kdmt1/volcarona_and_drought/,19,"I think Volcarona would be a good fit for the ability drought"". He is a sort of embodiment of the sun. He is literally the sun pokemon. His pokedex entries read as follows.

"" A sea of fire engulfs the surroundings of their battles, since they use their six wings to scatter their ember scales."" 

"" Thought to be an embodiment of the sun, it appeared during a bitterly cold winter and saved Pokémon from freezing.""

"" When volcanic ash darkened the atmosphere, it is said that Volcarona's fire provided a replacement for the sun.""

"" As it flies, it scatters its flaming scales. It was feared by ancient people, who referred to it as “the rage of the sun.”  
 Not only does drought fit his lore I think it fits his gameplay. Volcarona is so close to be good but he needs that something to make him better. Also we need more options for sunlight setup Pokémon. Not to mention is weakness to stealth rocks would make it hard for you to just swithch into him whenever you want to get sunlight up.

I had a friend who said that ""Volcarona is like Unova's Tyranitar. At least defensibly Tyranitar typing sucks but he is so good he makes it work and you have to play around that"" Well one thing that makes playing around Tyranitar weakness is his sand stream ability.",1678136015.0

But i played every game / gen to this day with Scarlet/Violet and if we are honest, 3rd gen really is the best of pokemon 

- Only gen where we have 2 distincts team fighting and both are included in the other game (Team Magma is in Saphire or AS for exemple)
- One of the best trio starter
- Best post game content in the days and even with the ORAS remake (Delta episode)
- Secret Bases
- Pokemon Contest
- The Regi-trio is by far the best trio within all game (i’m waiting on S/V to see maybe)

And with gen 6 we got Soaring with Latios/Latias and megas? The only thing that Hoenn is missing is character customization like in X/Y

I like the other game as well don’t get me wrong but even if i take i step back, i feel 3rd gen is the best fully complete of them all

I picked up PoGo in December to help me walk more. Since I was starting from nothing, I've been slowly building endurance and walking more and more. 

I take breaks and sit at picnic tables or benches around the neighborhoods so I can rest, catch mon, and then go on to walk the next leg of my journey. 

Last night I was sitting on a bench outside the leasing office of an apt complex I frequent (two stops at the entrance and higher than the normal mon spawns) and two cops showed up. They said someone complained and they were checking if I'm ok. I told them what I was doing and asked if I'm not supposed to be there and they just kinda rolled their eyes and said we just came to see if you're ok bc someone called. 

Since they didn't seem to care, I thought it was fine. Well I had a cig and went to leave when more people showed up. I saw two old people talking to the cops, so clearly the ones that complained, and then a leasing office person showed up too. I was leaving so they all followed me and she was like ""you can't be there, you're scaring the residents, it's private property"" so I said ok and left. 

It's fine. It sucks but the neighborhood next to it also has a bench and there's a gym at that entrance, so whatever. But it's been bothering me since. I feel like I did something wrong and I just feel shitty. 

Why are people so annoying? I walk by with my golden, sit on a bench outside, and then leave. I don't bother anyone. What is scary about a 40+ overweight lady with a golden catching pokemon?

I just feel sad.",1678474036.0

Great news! For me!,29,11o5pan,pokemongo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/11o5pan/great_news_for_me/,13,"So I just started playing about five months ago and you couldn’t peel me off of this game if the fate of the world depended upon it.

Unfortunately I’ve been spoiled as I started playing while living in downtown Baltimore. A couple weeks ago I moved to Bumf**k Nowhere, Maryland and the game become somewhat of a chore. There were 2 pokestops here and no gyms. I nominated a Pokéstop that got approved, and it’s right outside of my house! 

And then I nominated another one down the street about a week ago, and I just opened the app not only to find that it was approved, but that it became a gym!!! This is major news as I’m currently playing both my and my brother’s account, and we’re on different teams so now I’ll not only be able to raid every day, but I’ll even be able to make sure we both get our free 50 coins every day!",1678494308.0

I made a friend from Leekduck’s Raid now page almost a year ago. We send/open gifts with sticker daily, and later on I noticed that every time I send a gift which from a pokestop that I haven’t sent her before, she pins the gift. Then, I always send her gift from a new stop and she started to do the same thing, sending me gift from a new stop almost every time. She’s from Japan and I’m in Canada. I like pinning her gifts too.

This update worries me...,9,11o5dte,pokemongo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/11o5dte/this_update_worries_me/,3,"[https://imgur.com/a/TXlOLUA](https://imgur.com/a/TXlOLUA)

&#x200B;

So I don't know how other players have found the game recently, but for me it's been insanely disappointing. Each event seems worse and worse, and every update Niantic pushes out just seems to add more bugs or performance issues that never get addressed. To top it off, tomorrow is Elite raid day...

&#x200B;

I reluctantly plan to be out for it. Despite how poor the game has felt lately, and despite how I hate what these elite raids stand for: a raid that blocks a gym for 24 hours, which you have to take part in in-person and requires coordinating with other players without the ability to remote invite from afar. Something pretty much impossible for a small (almost non-existant) community like mine. I've tried using Campfire to arrange raids in the past, but because it's still closed off to the majority of players, nobody where I live (in the middle of nowhere) seems to bother using it. It also lags my phone out, so instead, despite the fact I have Elite raids spawned fairly close by, I have to coordinate with friends through Discord and travel 10 miles away to have **any** hope of taking part. Even then, I don't know if we'll have enough players, since there's only 3 or 4 others who I know are definitely taking part.

&#x200B;

I don't mind the travelling part really; probably since I'm used to all the extra travelling and subsequent expense this game causes by now, and honestly it is at least a little better this time since they properly advertised the elite raid day. Afterall, I heard absolutelty nothing about the last elite raid day until I saw the raid eggs pop up. But after the Hoenn tour... I just feel less and less motivation to play this game. Not to rant about that too much, but 2 shinies is what I managed - this was after travelling **even further afield** (20ish miles?) to a town that has a much higher spawn density and number of players. I played for the full 8 hours the first day, caught god knows how many Pokemon with my Pokeball plus, hatched a bunch of eggs, and did a bigger bunch of raids. I even kept an eye on the ""journal"" log to see whether any shinies fled whilst being caught on auto with the Pokeball Plus... nothing. Just the one Pokemon I got from a research task (a pokemon I'd already had shiny), and the kinda cool, kinda dissappointing wild shiny Latias... which I also already had one of. None of the new shinies. None of the regional egg ones. Not the much vaunted shiny Groudon I really wanted, or another shiny Kyogre (I got very lucky with a trade a few years back at least). Not even any of the decent shinies I already had, but was still hunting like crazy.

&#x200B;

Honestly, I've never had good luck with the tour days. Hell, both previous tours I either broke my phone, or had catastrophic tech problems - feel like the tour events are a curse for me at this point. But this time I seriously went all out... and that's all I get? I spent money on the Jirachi questline thinking I'd at least get 2 extra incenses for the weekend (since they did list that as a bonus), only to be stung because I forgot they love to make the tour questlines absurdly long and tedious, and literally impossible to finish quickly. I'm hardly surprised that for the third Tour event in a row I completely failed to get a shiny Unown, something I've been hunting since the beginning... and yet they make it a requirement for the dex completion to get every Unown as a shiny?! Then let's not forget how they didn't put out any real info until the last minute, generously made the event ""free""... but then took away the 8 bonus raid passes that usually come with the event, to force players to buy premiums or remote passes in the shop. I honestly feel the only reason they made it free was so they had the excuse to lower shiny rates etc., since ""it's free, so people can't complain"". And let's also not forget how bad the Las Vegas players had it, because the location locked ticketed events always seem to be a catastrophe (plus didn't the game ticket cost like $70 with all the added extras, before even having to buy plane tickets & accommodation?!).

&#x200B;

...And with regards to this latest update notification, is all of that supposed to be part of their ""renewed commitment to bolstering Pokemon Go's in-person experience""? Because from what I can see, they've just been making the game worse, regardless of whether you play in-person or from home. I mean for crying out loud, if you want players to play and raid in person, for one thing **actually give more XL rare candies from doing raids in person**. That was meant to be a thing for a while now, but in-person raids still **almost never** drop them.

&#x200B;

Honestly, I'm just... so done with this company, and this game right now. I've had problems with Niantic for years... and I mean of course I have, since I'm a rural player. It felt like things might finally improve a bit when they added the Coronavirus concessions, because they actually made the game more accessible. But they just seem intent on stripping all of that back and then some. And that's precisely why this update message worries me.

&#x200B;

Before this elite Raid day event, I practically stopped playing for 2 full weeks. And you know what? I actually had fun, because I wasn't playing this game. I still play occassionally because it's a weak excuse to get exercise and meet up with friends, but honestly... even if tomorrow goes well, I'm honestly considering just quitting altogether.

&#x200B;

As a last note, if you're feeling the same way... here's something I feel is pretty relevant: [https://imgur.com/gallery/a1sxiIT](https://imgur.com/gallery/a1sxiIT)

**Edit -** Fixed the formatting. Also sorry for making this such a long rant.

Idk what else i could add really im just REALLY bored of the current state of customization and curious to know if anyone else feels the same way or if im alone on this, obviously character customization isnt what pokemon games are really known for in the slightest *cough* scarlet and violet *cough*  but i feel like itll add some freshness to what can be some really dull points waiting in-between events and updates

-ANOTHER Meditite
-ANOTHER Skarmory
-ANOTHER Sinnoh stone (WHY?!?)
-The occasional silver pinap
-ANOTHER Wingull


I cannot be the only one baffled by this. Maybe an incubator, some gimmighoul coins, or even a random amount of poke balls, maybe even the occasional bonus battle, a sun stone perhaps, lure module….LITERALLY anything other than the trash completion prizes they constantly and repetitively give to players. 

Of all the Pokémon they say you can get, I consistently get the same rotating menagerie of instantly transferred nonsense. I don’t need more skarmory candies or an unending amount of sinnoh stones that I have no use for at this point in my gameplay, like seriously let me go out of my way to find a rhydon to use it on, it is seriously infuriating.

Of all the things to do in PoGo, I enjoy battling. It’s not about the prizes whatsoever, I’d greatly appreciate an unlimited battle cap and stardust as opposed to literally ANY of the so called completion prizes.

This, coupled with an actually pretty good amount of gyms always meant everybody got their full coins every day. But for quite some time now, some months, one person seems to have some personal issue with me and a few others. As soon as one of us enters a gym, she immediately kicks us out, often leaving the gyms empty or only kicking us and none other player. We know her personally, so we know for a fact that she spoofs.
We have been reporting her countless times, I even reached out to Niantic on Twitter, only for them to tell me to contact the inhale support which, oh wonder, just sends some AI generated reply that they’ll look into it. It really has been months by now, and the fact that she still hasn’t had any consequences happen to her while she terrorizes other players, paying players as well, is beyond me. It’s getting extremely frustrating to a point where I often don’t feel like playing anymore, but on the other hand I don’t want to quit because I love the game, the franchise, and it always has been so much fun.

Elite raids are an amazing feature and the community overreacts every time they come around.,0,11o3umo,pokemongo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/11o3umo/elite_raids_are_an_amazing_feature_and_the/,25,"Yes they require you to do in groups with no remote raids. Yes they are harder than regular raids and require more people. No you don’t have a community to play with. We get it.

Do you expect Niantic to make content only for people who play remote or don’t have communities people to play with?(they do)

Or do you expect Niantic to not make content for people who do have communities and like to play in person?

Almost anyone can agree this game is a lot more fun to play when you have people to play with, so why do we bash events designed to bring us together. 

I understand a lot of you are rural and it’s harder for you to find groups or coordinate with others and I feel that, Niantic should do something for those people. 

However it still stands that a vast majority of you live in cities with Pokémon Go communities that you haven’t gone to look for or attempted to participate in at all. There is no way all of you are rural. 

Every elite raid event, thousands of people go out and enjoy playing with people in their communities and it’s brought a lot of people together and made the game generally more enjoyable for most. You meet people to trade with and coordinate with, maybe even some GBL. It’s a genius feature for bringing people together which is a main goal for Niantic and so far it seems to have worked. 

TLDR: A lot of you complain about elite raids but have made 0 effort to join your local communities, most of you aren’t rural, and Elite Raids have brought thousands of people together to play the game enhancing the game experience considerably. The game is more fun with others so why so much hate on events meant to help with that.",1678489578.0

Now im back in and raiding and making friends etc. but i have a TON of 2016,17,18 and so on. But mostly 2016 (some from launch week too!) 


Not sure how the mechanics work though.

Assume player A and player B both have Guaranteed Lucky(GL) pokemon. 


Player A trades a GL to player B for a pokemon that player B wants to make lucky. 

Player A now has Player B’s (now) Lucky Pokemon
Player B now has Player A’s (old) Lukcy Pokemon

I understand (I think) this much. 

Now:
Can Player A trade back Player B’s Lucky Pokemon for a random “throwaway” Pokemon? 



TLDR: If someone wants a pokemon to be Lucky, can they trade it to someone with a Guaranteed lucky and then trade back to receive their original pokemon (now lucky)?",1678411377.0

I suspect someone has deliberately placed them next to there house, since the gym is hogged most of the time.
