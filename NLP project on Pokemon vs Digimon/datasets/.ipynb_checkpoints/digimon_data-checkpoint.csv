With the Steam version out, Switch physical versions shipping, & Switch digital versions about to come out country by country, seemed about the right time for a Digimon World: Next Order thread.

The game is out February 22nd worldwide.

&#x200B;

Digimon World: Next Order is a PC & Switch port of the PS4 version of Next Order (called International Edition in Japan.) The 2017 PS4 port was a heavily upgraded port of the 2016 Vita game, which had a focus on upgrading the look of the game, and lessening bugs and glitches (along with adding new content.)

&#x200B;

The PC & Switch versions should be near identical to the PS4 version of the game as far as overall content goes, with the main differences being two tweaks:

A Beginner Mode- which has enemy difficult reduced.

Dashing- The player character can now run, which is 1.4x faster than the standard walking, which should speed-up gameplay quite a bit.

&#x200B;

Content that was added later to Next Order on PS4 should be there from the beginning, once you can unlock it.

The game has 232 Digimon in it.

Digimon World: Next Order is a single player game.

&#x200B;

The store pages are up on digital, the time when purchases go up may change based on where you live, so be aware:

Physical Switch copies are in the midst of shipping, and Bandai has said physical stock will be limited.

Just wanted to talk about my experience with Digimon and what I'm looking to do next, could use some guidance

Cyber Sleuth was my first attempt to get into the series a number of years ago. I actually liked the game a lot but got really confused at managing and collecting Digimon. Some would evolve into each other's evolution lines (from what little I know about them) and I'd start losing like, 'identity' of who was who. I eventually tried it again at some point but gave up again for the same reasons.

Meanwhile I picked up what I think is the Ver. 20th virtual pet. I got the yellow one because I heard something about a special Gabumon egg, and with how little I know of Digimon, I *do* know that I'm a big fan of Gabumon, Garurumon, and Metal Garurumon.

I'm an overthink-er and a worry-er, so I didn't last TOO long with the virtual pet, but I did enjoy my time with it and thought it was pretty awesome. Tamagotchis are mega nostalgic for me. Hell, I even had a *Godzilla* one as a kid. I'm a massive tokusatsu nut, so that was right up my alley. (I also missed the whole idea of ""making mistakes is part of the fun because it influences which Digimon you get"")

Then, because I'm a massive tokusatsu nut, I got a Vital Bracelet back when they weren't even a thing in the US yet (where I live). I got a couple DIM cards (Kuuga, Ultraman Z, and Sevenger) and basically used one of each character.

By the time I finished with the cards, I realized I was losing interest in the VB because it kinda wasn't what I'd hoped it would be.

The daily exercises didn't really seem.. I dunno, accurate forms of exercise I guess. And I knew the thing worked best as a step-counter which did give me some motivation to go walking, but having to repeatedly scan my phone (it has a NFC in it) to get them to battle got really old really fast. Sure the battling can get a little grindy on the virtual pet too, but at least you're just pressing a button and not having to scan a thing that works maybe 95% of the time.

I had actually already bought the US Vital Hero with Gabumon (AND a Gammamon card) by the time my interest fizzled out completely. I do still have all of this stuff and am always thinking of starting it up again, but the somewhat annoying grind of battling always takes me back out of it.

Plus I just found out the apps for both my toku characters and Digimon are apparently closing this month, soooooo.. there goes that, I guess.

Life went on, and the past couple weeks I started thinking about Digimon again. The last Pokemon Direct kinda killed my Pokemon interest for the time being, and a discord server I hang out in all the time is always talking up Digimon (that's where I discovered Gammamon, who is *adorable*), so I figured I'd give it another shot with Next Order.

Next Order's been fun, and the subreddit's helped a lot with figuring things out (along with MrW01FY's tutorial videos which are invaluable), but I think I've just got so much going on in my day-to-day that I'm getting burned out on big games like this. 

So I'm thinking about shelving it for the time being (for big games, I send myself an email detailing where I left off so that I can pick right back up in the future and it's been incredibly helpful) and going right back to the Ver. 20th. 

The way I see it, the Ver. 20th. should be fun to add to my daily life (especially with the whole ""don't worry about making mistakes"" thing), and it's simple enough that it won't require a ton of brainpower.

So I mean, I guess I'm veering toward just re-activating that one and yeah. But I do still give the Vital Bracelet some thought, even though the scan-grinding and having to get some walking done every day can be a little daunting. Buuut the Ver. 20th. is also a couple years old by now (I think?), so I also wonder if something's out there that might be more my speed. Although if I'm looking for a simplistic experience, maybe the Ver. 20th. is the best thing. *Although* I know the Ver. 20th works best if you raise two Digimon at once, and I'm wondering if I'd be better off with a device of the same style that only has you raise one at once.

I dunno.

There's my rambling though! Any thoughts would be appreciated and thank you for reading!",1678509224.0

Some doubts about the Digi-Battle/Hyper Colosseum card game,0,11o2rux,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/11o2rux/some_doubts_about_the_digibattlehyper_colosseum/,2," Hello,  
 

since the new Digimon card game reignited my love for Digimon, I tried  to retreive the Digi-Battle cards I (tried to) play with when I was a  child. Back then I just had a bunch of cards with no ruleset (I have no  idea how it happened that I owned those cards), and I had to look for  the rules with a 56K connection and I asked a friend of my dad to  translate them from english to italian lol. So, it was kind of a mess  but it mostly worked.  
 

Anyway, I tried to retrieve the rules today and I found lots of  discussions on the internet, about how the game was broken especially  comparing the japanese and the english version, and I have some  questions I still hadn't quite found an answer for. I hope there's still  someone who knows this game here, since I saw a couple of old threads.  
 

I'll use these three cards as reference for the first question: 

https://preview.redd.it/pb3k1p8mlzma1.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aaff7e0339f94a6f2921be6ddd9d6841a06dc762

 1) Vaccine - Data - Virus. In the Digimon canon it should be supposed to  be sort of rock-paper-scissor, while as far as I got, in the japanese  game it's A-B-C loosely tied to attributes, but A(against ""vaccine"")  attacks are always the strongest and C(against ""virus"") the lowest, but C  attacks set the opponent's attack to 0.  
 

This doesn't really look like rock-paper-scissor to me: C/virus Digimon  basically always have an attack of 0 unless some specific option card  (or rare digimon effect) is able to change this, right? Am I getting  something wrong? Is there some counterbalance that makes C/Viruses  stronger on some other aspect? (For example easier/cheaper  digivolutions)  
 

In the western version, instead, there's nothing that sets opponent's  attacks to 0, but the weakest attack, called ""Defend"", has something  different yet also weird:  
 \- For Virus Digimon, the Defend attack is the one against Vaccines (correctly so)  
 \- For Data Digimon, the Defend attack is the one against Viruses (correctly so)  
 \- For Vaccine Digimon, the Defend attack is the one against other Vaccines (???)  
 

While in the JPN version Virus were the weakest, now it seems Data  digimon are the weakest: no-one ever uses their weakest attack agains  them. Again, is there something I'm missing about balance?  
 

2) This wiki -> [https://wikimon.net/Digital\_Monster\_Card\_Game](https://wikimon.net/Digital_Monster_Card_Game) says that there was also a format called **""Ultimate Battle Level** 「アルティメットバトルレベル"", described as ""An advanced format in which each player plays three Digimon at once, instead of the usual one.""  
 Since I'm kinda tempted to improve the game taking inspiration from another game (called [Air, Land, and Sea](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/247367/air-land-sea))  that I think would fit quite well, I'm surprised to see there was  indeed a format that used three Digimon at once (like I would like the  change the game into). I couldn't find any info about that whatsoever,  though; I even Google-translated the japanese link that was supposed to  explain that format, but it described the regular japanese rules  instead. Do you know anything about this format with 3 Digimon at once?  
 

3) How do these card work? Why are they put face down on Power Port,  while the other option cards don't say so? (Also the italian version of  ""To Champion"" says you take your Champion from your Deck, instead than  from your hand... the translation really sucks, ugh). For the ""To  Champion"" card, what do you do with the downgraded Ultimate/Mega? Is it  sent offline, or in your hand, or what?

[Digimon World: Next Order]Chapter 2 stat farming method,9,11ni66q,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/11ni66q/digimon_world_next_orderchapter_2_stat_farming/,1,"Best part of this method is that it doesn't require end-game/post-game content to do so. However, you do need lv4 item shop upgrade(for max tent 10x, although 3x or 6x tent works, just would not be as effective as 10x tent), and lv2 sender upgrade, to be able to go to these places. This makes it possible for you to max your digimon(apart from HP/MP) and be ready to crush everything in your path with ease.  


4 required things you need to set this up + optional:  
\*Lv4 Item Shop upgrade(for 10x tent usages)  
\*Lv2 Sender upgrade(for Hinterland locations unlock)  
\*Desync'd newborn digimon with helper at about 4kish stats to be safe to be able to help train your newborn digimon  
\*Tamer skill ""Sleep Care"" - must have as to not rest as often - otherwise you only recover 10% fatigue instead of 20% fatigue - if you don't have this tamer skill, use Angemon in hospital to recover fatigue instead - every time you rest, one in hour game is gone from training  
\*\*Lv5 Resturant(for best food boosting stats, or you can just do 500 hp/mp one)\*\* \*\*Optional\*\* \*\*Expensive, but best and easiest\*\*  


Abusing tent to rest fatigue, and autopilots for Serph's food, the one with 1500 hp/mp or 500 hp/mp and you'll be set for end game/post game. Bear in mind, this only works FOR Rookie stage, not in-training I / in-training II / Champion / Ultimate / Mega / Ultra(Gold Mega).  


First, we want to go to Wargrowlmon(orange) lv 35 and farm it until max STA, the WIS/SPD will be capped at 6200ish, meanwhile STR will be capped at 8800ish. Location: Faulty Ex Machina Hinterland via Sender and go towards East Coast. There's a solo Wargrowlmon(orange) lv 35 RIGHT there by borders, which you can reset very fast.  


Afterwards, go to Weregaurumon(black) lv 45, and farm it until max WIS/SPD. Location: Bony Resort Hinterland via Sender and go towards Night Church, and it's very small room which you can reset very fast.  


As for STR, you can abuse tent: As in go in tent and break it, to respawn digimon, instead of running back and forward. Location: Faulty Ex Machina Hinterland via Sender and go towards Pathfork Island. Go to Metalgreymon(Blue) lv 38. It should max your STR.  


Also, DO NOT sleep OR rest the fatigue OR eat the meals UNLESS it's about 10 seconds BEFORE the hour ends upon them asking to sleep/rest/eat. Reason being that sleep resets the fatigue, meals - if bought in resturants - reduces fatigue, so it's okay to keep pushing them until 5-10 seconds before hour ends. However, do make sure fatigue doesn't go beyond 70-80%. Only IF you are getting fatigue right before sleep or meal, by all means, go ahead and push them but only right BEFORE they get 100% fatigue or 10 seconds before the hour, which will result in training failure - and in some cases, reduce their lifespan. Example: 12:00 and 18:00 is when they get hungry, ignore their hunger until 12:50 and 18:50 respectively, and autopilot back to city and teleport to resturant right away.  


Another thing to point out, to be as effective as you can be with timing, always use teleport between areas in city(using menu button), no running around in city, and make sure to press menu button in game if you want to pause, so that the in-game clock won't tick. Buy a lot of portable potties and autopilots, along with HP/MP/Remedy recovery disks. When you do get back to city, ALWAYS fix your tent immediately to be able to keep resetting the area/rest fatigue.

Me being an artist had to make graphics to see how these would look like.

It's not perfect. Text isn't written like the card game and the cards might come off as unbalanced, too strong or too weak... but it was just for fun and pretty sure if the creators of the card game ever do implement Appmon into the card game... it would be ten times better than these.

As a fan, I turned to Digimon and nostalgia to help me through a difficult period at the beginning of the pandemic. Now that I am in a better place, I am ready to pass on my collection to fellow fans who will give these items the love and respect they deserve.

The collection includes a Digivice Ver. Complete, which is brand new and has never been opened. Additionally, I have three devices from the Pendulum Z and Pendulum Z II series: Nature Spirits, Deep Savers, and Virus Busters. The Nature Spirits packaging is torn, but the device is still in excellent condition. The Deep Savers device has been opened to check if it's working, but it's still in new condition. The Virus Busters device has also been opened and works perfectly.

Furthermore, I have a few Vital Bracelet DiMs, including a Guilmon, Renamon, and Terriermon collection. These are also available for bidding on eBay.

I am selling my collection because I am going through a difficult time and need the money. If you are interested in any of these items, please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions or make an offer.

Thank you for taking the time to read this post, and I hope these items find a new home with someone who will appreciate them as much as I have.

What are your opinions on Omnimon Merciful Mode?,17,11mc6xq,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/11mc6xq/what_are_your_opinions_on_omnimon_merciful_mode/,28,"I think he looks very cool, but I really dislike the wings and the new sword.The wings are too thin. I feel that what really brought Omnimon's base design together was his cape. Omnimon has a really slender and thin body, and his cape made his overal sihlouette bulkier, as well as just being plain cool. Without it, Omimon looks kind of scrawny and fragile. Not to say that his armor is not cool loking, but the cape elevated his desing so much. Maybe if Merciful Mode had something more akin to UlforceVeedramon's more cape-like wings.Also, I don't think the single edged curved sword fits. I feel that this type of sword does not work for Omnimon. Since the sword lies parallel to the orientation of his arm, he cannot quickly change the orientation of the sword's cutting edge, making it kind of cluncky.Anyway, what do you guys think about this Ipod looking boy?

I know someone made a post about Rewriting Davis Motomiya, but he wasn't specific. Davis Motomiya is really underrated in my opinion, but, honestly, I prefer him over TK and Kari, who are terrible characters in my opinion(Sorry 1999 fans). I feel like he there was a lot of untapped potential in him and if he had more character growth and development, then he, I hope I don't jinx it, would be one of the best Goggle-Heads.

If I were to rewrite Daisuke, then I would still keep his hot-headed personality and make him a bit obnoxious but tone it down. He would still see Tai as a idol to him and wouldn't have that annoying crush he had on Kari. In my personal rewrite of 02, Jun would be cut out and he would be a single child, but his dad died when he was just 5 months old, as a baby. I'd have his character arc be him learning to become his own leader instead being a ripoff of Tai.

By the end of my rewrite, he'd still be a bit hot-headed, but is no more obnoxious and, instead, more serious and cocky and, kind of, humble like his sub counterpart. Now, I know you guys are going to say ""make him similar to his sub counterpart"" and that's fine. Just I want to see some creativity about how you would make him better.",1678227440.0

I was wondering if this charger I got from Huawei would be alright to charge my BE without frying its battery? It says here that the output is 5.0V 1.0A 5.0W while the input is 100-240V - 50/60Hz, 0.2A.

1.

Can anyone clarify what exactly it means lol

2. I heard you could launch both partner Digimon's specials at the same time, is that true? Dunno if I'm doing something wrong but when I order one special, it seems like I can't do anything else til they're done using it.

3. How do you decrease discipline? I feel like literally everything I do increases it. I'm actually somewhat sure that *scolding* increases it a bit too.

End Game/Future Device Possibilities,0,11kpuyh,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/11kpuyh/end_gamefuture_device_possibilities/,1,"Hey im just here to rant some idea or things i would love to see in the future and was curious what other people would love to see also or think about all this.

\-My main wish would be to see them remake all devices from each gen and update them adding Wif/phone link while also creating a better app sorta like Pokemon go that links to all devices.

\-The app would then have purchasable Digimon lines, storage, online battle arenas for pvp everything should be crossdevice transferable and replace dim cards and  create like more storage or add micro SD card system to the devices so people can just use it to transfer progress offline this way.

\-There would be events, boss raids, certain free eggs/digimon earned via quests like walking distance or battle wins, earning cosmetics for avatars via rank or raids also cosmetic  sales to earn the company money and keep the game alive.

\-Rework of the battle and stat system for the digimon for example weekly/daily distance travel  plus ur average heart rate should impact the digimons HP stat by adding like say 5-10% to its max potential in that area so not all digimon are the equal, while battles wins losses affect its Power.   
\-Player levels should be added with other systems such as total eggs raised, battles, quest finished, travel distance, Exercises completed which impact your digimons ability to grow and power.

\-A crest system sorta like club/house depending on what crest you choose at the start it should add % to a certain stat and monthly rewards for top  players of each crest house.

examples Courage- 5% power, Love % Faster egg growth etc 

\-They could also add like a healing system where walking a certain distance allows you to battle again at raids to earn exp/ stats to slow down progress a tad  and make it slightly grindy so its not super easy

\-As for how the company would make money they could Sell digimon lines, Cosmetics, special event tickets to earn eggs and they could implement battle passes to earn eggs cosmetics (none of this should be pay to win just cosmetic and unique for people that want to support and look different.

i know this all sounds  like Pokemon go but yeah haha would love digimon to  make something of that caliber where we can all interact, battle and more modern style then just evolve walk etc.   
Would love to hear other peoples ideas of what they would like to see and think of all this maybe you still love the old style and don't want it to change.",1678165504.0

have they been phasing out the XC and the XD completely due to those errors?

What if we had Digimon partners in our world?,14,11j5oj3,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/11j5oj3/what_if_we_had_digimon_partners_in_our_world/,20,"Hey,  
First, I hope that I use the right flair. To me Meta means out of the usual context and in greater scope, like even touching our reality.

I, and especially my inner child, love Digimon so much. So much to learn there and I find a lot of comfort. For the following, I want to clearify that I watched the Digimon series in German.

A while ago, I had a new perspective on what Digimon are. They are a manifested representation of their partner's heart. And I love this so much. I'm into deep stuff. 😁

Yesterday something came to my mind and it hit me: What would our world look like if we had Digimon partners? Then I went deep into it.

How would that be even possible? In that story a videogame would be created at some point, at first it just being a game. With time Digimon would get conscious about themselves being alive and after a while leaving the videogame. They would find a way to communicate with us. First maybe through computers, showing up as eggs on the desktop. Us being curious we interact with them, like we know it as Tamagotchi. At first thinking it would be just a game or something, they might start speaking to us at some point, and slowly realizing that they truly live, for many people hard to believe at first. But with time we would bond with them in a very special way.

For some, when they would touch their screen, longing to feel their Digimon close to them, they would either get sucked into a kind of digital world, meeting their partner, and together coming back into our world, living together there. Or their Digimon partner would leave the digital world at some point, when their bond is strong, meeting their human partner in our world.

This would happen around the world, for those who are ready. Remember, they are a representation of their human partner's heart. Not everyone is ready to face that. We learned to suppress a lot of pain, which would come up as well, when they meet (maybe not as first and maybe only subconsciously, but it needs the will to face it, to accept it, integrating that pain).

From there many stories could be told and those special bonds would be truly magical. I am so fascinated with that.

At the same time, conflict would arise. People without Digimon might resent those with Digimon. The military would want to use Digimon as weapons and would successfully do so by creating devices to control them. They would force them to digivolve into dark digivolutions.

Some Digimon in the digital world who do not agree with humans having partners, would manipulate governments and the military for their own agenda.

I could go in more detail, but I will leave it here for now.

What do you think about this idea? Is it worth being realized in some kind of form?",1678039574.0

Ryudamon with its ryu series was made to explore the potential of digimon fighting strength with the data of dragons and generals of japanese culture, hence he becomes a weapon for alphamon where all of his fighting strength is focused exclusively to its attacks.

The ultimate Digimon game idea!,1,11hvb4y,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/11hvb4y/the_ultimate_digimon_game_idea/,12,"Hello community, I've been an avid digimon fan and have loved the brand, show, and games for a long time. I literally grew up on it. I have a game concept that I would love to see happen and wonder why it never has been done. It would put pokemon and many other competing brands to shame and make the digimon brand a lot of money. I'm putting this out there now just because I wish it would eventually happen.

&#x200B;

The game concept is a mobile app where your phone is a digivice. The general function is that of the tradition v1 digivices where you raise, train, and battle your monster with your friends... just maybe not as time consuming on the maintenance side and more focus on the training because of today's attention span. You could even do it with a digivice type device in replacement of a mobile phone app to increase sales.... just updated for modern times. The funnest part of the digivice was schooling your friends on the playground with the monster you raised.

&#x200B;

The next aspect of the game is the heftier side of the development.  Create a MMO with a campaign to play along side the monster(s) you raise on your device in the digital world. The stats and monster would literally upload/download based on how you train them on the mobile app/digivice. You could even recreate the world and story while referencing the old TV shows and games. Have a party feature for kid's and fans to party up and have fun together after school/work. A battle and tournament aspect would be a necessity for people who want to focus on monster raising and training on a world class scale. Add armour and special digivolution quests in the game and finish with a saving the world with your monster (in the story) or create a global game event... or you could create a world that keeps developing and have different seasons. (season 1, 2 3, etc.)

They wouldn't have to even make this game as a one-off because they could add new aspects and stories to the game the further the game develops. It would be much better than the cyber slueth/digimon world games they have been developing because they could tell their story and add new features based on the season of the game they are on. Introduce new exclusive items and add expansions as well.

So how you bandai make money other than the app/digivice? Create microtransactions for different accessories for monsters/character avatars in the game... could even have stat boosts to buy if you wanted but would not recommend a pay to win option.... Also keep developing the many digimon stories into the game.  It would be much better than the cyber slueth/digimon world games they have been developing because they could tell their story and add new features based on the season of the game they are on. Introduce new exclusive items and add expansions based on the stories as well.

Anyway, would love to hear the fandom's thoughts and maybe someday see  game like this happen. I've been thinking about it for years but will never have the ability to develop it myself so I figured I'd give my idea to the world and see if anything comes of it.

&#x200B;

If you would want to see a game like this please help get this concept out so the developers and other digimon brand managers in this community can see it. I would love to live in a world where I actually train and raise a digimon that feels like an actual partner!",1677922814.0

Then why did I still get it?

With Humulos in the discord we determined that as MetalPiranimon you would also need to clear the last area to get Lillithmon.

Feel free to DM me if you have further questions - welcome to the digital world

BT - refers to base set. Bt1-3 in Japan were released in NA as 1.0 and 1.5. After that we match Japan with BT4 great legend. So: BT4 - great legend (Ancient garurumon/greymon, Lucemon yellow) BT5 - Battle of Omni (omnimon X, Zwart defeat) BT6 - double diamond (alphamon, beelstarmon, bt1 Ghost Omni Alt Art like 1/4 cases;1/96boxes BT7 - Next Adventure (purple Lucemon, Susanoomon - hybrid heavy set) BT8 - New Awakening (jogress evo, dual colours appear - paladin mode, and creepymon) BT9 - X Record: hard at to find because so many good cards for meta decks like melga (deathexmon, alphamon:ouryuken mode) BT10 - Xros Wars SAVE mechanic (Shoutmon king, Jesmon GX) BT11 - MOST RECENT RELEASE Feb.17/23 (Rina Shinomiya, Galactimon)

For top meta decks, watch egg man on YouTube who covers winning deck profiles from comps. Use the Digimon card website to find out which shops in your area have tourneys, as well as online ones, sign up/download the Bandai TCG+ app. To learn the game mechanics, obvs play but watch CardProtagonist on YouTube - they are an incredible resource for digi players

There are also EX sets, so far 3: ex1-classic collection (machinedramon, analog youth hype), ex2-digital hazard (mothermother, gallant, beelze hype), and ex3-Draconic roar (chaosdramon, 4 great dragons, and Examon hype.

Digimon Adventure 2020,3,11gj4mt,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/11gj4mt/digimon_adventure_2020/,7,"I just finished adventure 2020 (I know I’m late) and honestly I got… a lot of thoughts. Everything felt really off to me and I couldn’t put my finger on it but now I think I know why I thought adventure 2020 was underwhelming. So even though nobody asked for it, here’s a little review of mine:

First off I wanna say some things I really loved. Obviously the animation is beautiful, I appreciate the more fluent evolution sequences, too. Also the whole Ancient War storyline is ingenious. Giving our main Digimon past lives where they were great warriors and even have them face that past on occasion (like Gabumom did) was brilliant. I also adore the alternative evolution lines. Evolution is circumstantial and it works. I was really hyped when Omegamon suddenly had BlitGreymon and CressGarurumom appendices and basically the blade and gun switched. It was awesome. Also giving everybody megas was definitely the right call.

Sooo what went wrong in my opinion? My biggest 2 problems are the Crests and the fact that it doesn’t really work on its own.

It’s a reboot and still things only really make sense sometimes when you’ve watched the original. Like the part about Koushiro‘s parents, it’s never stated he is adopted. You only know from watching the original. And a lot of character benefits like how Takeru get’s a lot done on his own only feels satisfying because we know it wasn’t like this in the original. If you don’t consider that 90s Takeru had struggles being independent, 2020 Takeru doing things on his own just wouldn’t hit nearly as hard. But it’s worst when it comes to the Crests. Many character moments only work because we know what the crests mean long before the show explains what they are.

Speaking of the crests:
I didn’t mind that they weren’t objects to wear, honestly the amulets would’ve looked weird anyway on the modern designs. But I mind that they aren’t earned. Think about it we never find out what each crest stands for so and neither do the kids. So the entire idea of having to live up to the crest is gone.

Taichi isn’t abusing his courage because he doesn’t need to be courages for the evolution to work. I also don’t get why the crest of courage demands for him to check on his friends all the time. Should’ve been Yamato or Sora or not crest related. But his courage vision Valkyrimon moment was great.

Yamato the lone Wolf who has to learn the meaning of friendship is alone for what 3 episodes or so? And bam he’s part of the group. 

Sora fighting with Piyomon to protect her was great. Only problem: the original did it and did it better. Sora thinking her crest of love will never work, her problems with her mother all culminating to her realising she was loved because she does the same to Piyomon out of love is gone. I like the fact that she gets her crest at the end though and not when she reaches her mega. The volcano plot just didn’t feel earned.

Takeru‘s plot was fantastic in idea, wanting to help a digimon reach its sanctuary because he misses his own. Not giving up. Hope growing wings. It felt a little rushed though.

Jyou‘s story worked too. It was just way less significant to almost drowning trying to keep a promise.

Mimi‘s story about the school and purity was among the best. Especially since the purity was actually a goal set to achieve. Too bad we didn’t know she had the crest of purity.

Hikari really did embody light and life. Arguably more so than in the original. No complaints there. 

Koushiro solving riddles was a nice concept as well.

You see the quests for the crests themselves are not the problem. The problem is our characters just do their thing and happen to aquire the crests because of who they are. There is no idea of knowing what the crest means and having to work to grow into it. There was no character development and so there was little pay off.

One last thing I wasn’t so sure about was the digivices. The communication function is great and very useful. Only problem it reduces the scale of the world and adventure. Almost everybody has a flying digimon early on and can always find out where the others are so there is no being lost, the separation isn’t a risk but hardly inconvenient. I love how in the original they have to be close by to track each other. So they do run into each other but coming back together isn’t like meeting your friends at the mall.

All in all the reboot feels like a small scale sidequest with little accomplishment instead of well an Adventure.",1677798255.0

How would the Digidestined react to the many incarnations of Optimus Prime?,0,11gdb00,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/11gdb00/how_would_the_digidestined_react_to_the_many/,4,"Optimus Prime is one of my favorite superheroes of all time and I like the Digimon: Adventure saga. Now, I wonder how the Digidestined will react to the brave and noble leader of the heroic Autobots and his many different origins and personalities. My guess that they'll be awed by Optimus and would even see him as a father figure to them, Though that's G1 and Cyberverse, wonder how they will react to the other Optimus's. It's up to you to decide in the comments.

Reminder, I did enjoy it but I thought it would be easier for me to mention the things that I dislike.

1- Protaginst, he is a little too naive. He asks from the enemy something and expects them to do as he says .. goku from dragon ball is much smarter than him tbh. At the last arc SPOILERS >!His android friend keeps telling him through logic and reasons that he was being manipulated since they were kids because of his relationship to his grandfather and then they can throw him. Not only that, but also he allowed his android friend to 1 hit bootmon, corrupt him, bring that appmon that I forgot his name, and by extension leviation. Who needs the world and friends when you can have mental shock for 2 episodes, am I right? Sorry it just seemed a little too stupid!<


2- The abilities were really nice, to make the partner engaed in the fight somehow. However only 1 of the main cast used it constantly because that's his trait while the main character only used it once during the final 3 episodes and that's it. It was underutilized way too much also SPOILERS >!Did the android guy used an ability?? Because I don't recall that!<


3-The ending was kind of anti-climactic, as in I was expecting something like xros wars final fight, adventure 1, 2, tamers, adventure reboot, or even frontier. But no, it ended like shaman king 2021 ((kind of, but not really)). SPOILERS FOR BOTH >!you set up the cast and give them huge power up levels? Check. You give them an OP final boss? Check. You win by attacking altogether? Nope. You win by diplomacy-no-jutsu? Check!<


Having said what I disliked, it is a really fresh breath of air. The music, the catchy applink theme, and the characters are all great. (How great? That is for you to find out, sorry. If I write any longer, then no one would read this.)",1677746365.0

Things that need to be adressed peoperly.,6,11fescr,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/11fescr/things_that_need_to_be_adressed_peoperly/,12,"I can't for the life of me understand how they're going to be able to explain some big questions in two episodes?

1- GulusGammamon's mystery

This alone definitely needs a full episode to explain everything surrounding GulusGammamon like his past in the digital world, his association with Gammamon, his true motives and intentions. I'm afraid that we might not get a satisfying unswer in the next episode since it's likely to be revolved around the fight with BloomLordmon that might take 6-8 minutes of the episode's runtime which might result in a rushed explanation of Gulus's mystery which definitely plays a key role in Regulusmon's appearance. 


2- The time limit thing.

I thought they might explain this one last episode but they haven't so far and it definitely needs to be brought up and explained properly. 


3- Black Agumon, Black Galgomon and Black Growmon.


This one is the most I'm afraid about being explained in a half-assed way, they definitely have had something to do with Gulus from the beginning hence watching the situation from afar every time he shows up, and if we notice properly they don't have GulusGammamon's colour scheme on their bodies like Dagomon, Rafflesimon, Kuwagamon and Brakimon do.


I can't accept something like simply them being infected by the black corrosion, otherwise what would be the point of bringing them during all GulusGammamon's appearances particularly his latest one where all 3 of them gathered at once when Gulus asked Hiro to sync with him.",1677699621.0

At first I thought it was just fan art but for whatever reason I dug into it a little and found out about Adventure Tri. Decided ""wth"" I'll watch it I haven't watched Digimon in forever. Watched it, immediately fell back in love with it all, jumped on Hulu and watched the original series and 02, watched Tri again, watched Last Evolution, now I play Cyber Sleuth, now I play the TCG, I even bought a 3D printer so I could print (among other things) Digimon figurines. Also having grown up with the American version I had never heard the absolute bangers Butterfly and Brave Heart, but thankfully Tri had them included even in the dub. I also appreciated the use of the Digi-rap remix or whatever at the beginning as that was a nice dose of American Digimon nostalgia before getting to experience the *really* good music. The rest of the series is great, I loved Last Evolution even though I damn near balled my eyes out at the end, but something about Tri and the way it brought me back into Digimon after more than a decade makes it really special (even if now that I know more about the series again I can see the plot holes and all that haha)",1677727719.0

They just killed whatever Evangelion monster that meicoomon turned into, and that was that. What about King drasil? What about the ""gone bad"",  crazy eyed, younger suddenly, Gennai? You can't just tell me that homeostasis ""took care of him,"" and that's it. This drasil was the driving force behind everything. And where is alphamon? Is he to drasil what Hackmon is to homeostasis? 

Also.... what happened to himekawa? She get murdered by those fish digimon? She was just wandering the digital world or what? 

How do the kids explain what happened to ishijima? He just disappeared? I don't think people will take ""sacrifice"" as an answer. 

Lastly.... who the hell were the other 2 kids in pods that Tai found? I thought there were only 4 kids in the second series. There were 6 in pods. One of them was shaped like Kari from the second series for some reason. I just dont know who the hell they were. 

Thank you for humoring my silly questions.

a cool area idea for my DnDigimon idea,2,11dees0,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/11dees0/a_cool_area_idea_for_my_dndigimon_idea/,0,"So, I've been working off and on for my future Digimon DND campaign, and an area I'm really excited about getting to is an area within Greymon-species territory but close to the border that separates it from Dramon-species territory. When the players first get there they see railways before coming across an amusement park named ChuChewChooLand, the welcome signs and other signs showing a chibi designed Chumon winking. Now the digimon within the park are usually stages between baby1 up to champion, with one ultimate also showing up in signs, but nowhere to be seen in person in the park. Loads of agumons are here of all kinds, snow, black, toy, 2006 variants, and agumon nise also shows up in signs. Several Railmon are also around. The owner of the park is a Chumon named Mike (haha funny) and he is frequently seen running around the park either filling up stock on paraphernalia or talking to visitors. Nise Agumon on the other hand stays in a single area where he tells purposely bad jokes with a lot of slapstick. Now, there are bits of stuff around that normally wouldn't be in an amusement park, such as military barricades and multiple weapons closets.

When the players investigate around, they find that many of the digimon here don't know what they're talking about with the military stuff since they're just visitors for the most part. If they ask Nise Agumon he'll just tell them to buzz off and Chumon is very avoidant of the issue telling them to just enjoy the park, that's the whole reason it exists. It's not until they leave that they get accosted and possibly apprehended by some other digimon hiding outside the park. They see the classic poop digimon such as Numemon and Scumon as well as some various mechanical digimon. They're lead to the leader of this group, Tyutyumon and Damemon. They learn that this area previously used to be a military research facility and training camp, but Chumon got fed up with doing training. He sabotaged the camp by finding the code that controlled the immediate area and changed it all into an amusement park, bringing up some old Golemons to push everyone out. The barricades and weapons are still there as they weren't originally part of the area, and keeping them locked up keeps them away from the original group. So the players have a choice of either leaving or assisting in restoring the area back to how it was before. If they choose to assist and succeed, they'll get to hear how the Chumon wanted to make an area where noone had to worry about the war going on, he sees that he may have been in the wrong with his method. He'll relinquish control back to Tyutyumon. Tyutyumon will reward the group with a pair of Mechanorimon.

I really can't wait for a lot of these areas, the locomon thing connects to another plot I'm cooking up.",1677511368.0

The most pointless character in Ghost Game,0,11di0yt,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/11di0yt/the_most_pointless_character_in_ghost_game/,8,"Why in the world do the writers hate Ryudamon so much?

His debut episode was nonsensical and probably one of the worst ones in all of Ghost Game, which is funny as it introduced the idea of the Digivice being capable of purifying Digimon (something that might not even matter at all), and also had some of the worst interactions between Hiro and Ruli and Kiyo. But fine, that's subjective.

What's not subjective is the fact that his evolution was way too quick and random, his evolution episode wasn't focused on him, nor did he even get to fight in it, and he's done nothing aside from being a mount for the past 10+ episodes. These last few episodes, where Ginryumon FINALLY appeared again, he's done basically nothing and said nothing. Even when the group decides they'll go to the Digital World and defeat the great threat, a freaking Floramon got more lines than Ginryumon, who got to watch from the side like a child in detention. The second he evolved, he was relegated to just being a second Airdramon from the group (mind you, Espimon basically just became a THIRD Airdramon for the group upon evolving, but at least he gets some screentime and the group actually remembers he's one of their friends).

I know asking for Ryudamon to become Aoi or Maki's partner or something is a little much, and it's fine that he's not part of the climax in the Digital World, but he added so little to the show that you could basically just replace him with the Flying Nimbus from DB and you'd have the same thing. Honestly, that's insulting to the Flying Nimbus because it has more story and character than Ryudamon. Ryudamon's another character who the writers added despite having no clue of what to do with him, and they just gave up on him after a couple of episodes. Unironically, he could have added more to the story had Hiro and Gammamon had to kill him back in episode 40 or whenever the hell he showed up.

Ryudamon and his evolutions are awesome too, so it's just such a freaking waste. Then again, it's not like he's the character the writers hate most...

* Noticed that all of the children bar Tai and Meiko near the end of the 5th are content in reverting Meicoomon back to normal even if all facts point to that thing is beyond saving. When Omegamon crushed Ordinemon it's almost like they're doing what Homeostasis wants them to do despite we are supposed to believe that Homeostasis is in the wrong. (And then Hackmon told them that they either choose Meicoomon or civilization being hit back to the stone age with no guarantee that Meicoomon won't infect anything again or if Meiko would be considered a pariah for housing a world-wiper)
* Is Hikari even supposed to hate Taichi over killing Meicoomon despite all the facts point out that thing (Ordinemon) is beyond saving? I also think everyone just forgoes their former characterization to act like an angsty emo, but I haven't watched the 1996 adventure enough to make a discreetion.

I've tried, I really have, but my ADHD-plagued attention span can only take so much, and when I don't particularly care about most of the cast, it feels like more of a chore to get through than something I enjoy spending my free time on. I'm sure it's good, it just isn't what I'm looking for in a digimon series, I guess.",1677391748.0

I liked the game, setting, music, and a lot of the Digimon I came across. But I also got pretty confused by the evolution mechanics and such, especially with later evolutions

I also started watching the original Japanese version of the first show (I forget how far I got into it before life got in the way) and ended up really liking how each of the kids had only their one respective Digimon that they were bonded with. I thought that was pretty awesome in comparison to the ""collect'em all"" type of thing that most mon games do

Are there any games in the Digimon series that work that way? Where you only have one Digimon (and their evolutions and such)? 

I actually had had this same thought back when all this was first on my mind, and I went as far as to get the re-released virtual pet (got the yellow one), which I was into for a while before, again, life got in the way.

Few Questions About Next Order,0,11c4s3j,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/11c4s3j/few_questions_about_next_order/,11,"So, I finally I can get my hands playing Next Order because for some unique reasons, I can play on PC only, not consoles.

That said, I'm ofc not a new in Digimon Universe, I played majority of Digimon games before & understood how to approach the games. In quick glance I think NO is basically a newer version of DW1 & ReDigitize which I also already played before. I'm usually blind guide type player aka restrict myself from guides or advices. But there's a few questions that I'm really must ask:

1) is there any running option for this game, I mean the Tamer one ofc. The Tamer's movement is so slow & even if I recall NO is an old game, don't tell me I can't run? I mean the world is kinda 'open'-ish, sure comparing for ex Ys Games NO world map is a joke, but running feels a must when exploring nowadays in any games. 

2) since I can see the concepts that in the end you can max ur stats to max with any digimons, am I correct that the 'better' digimon is the one that have fast window animation skills, I recall in Digimon World 1 some digimon attack faster than others because of the animation & the certain skills related. Is this the same case with next order? Ofc I can see if their signature skills seems have different power base level & effects.

Gatchmon being Neutral-Data due to being a characterization of search engines, like Google or Bing, so Data attribute fits well in it. Offmon has Dark-Virus cuz was antagonist (almost villain) on two versions, but also for they ""Draining Energy"" ability, kinda  similar to a vampire one.

I'm hoping for:

* All the digimon from Next Order, Cyber Sleuth, and Rearise to be included
* The addition of more X-antibody digimon that aren't all mega-level
* ZeedMilleniummon, Huanglongmon Ruin Mode, Zekegreymon, Arresterdramon Superior Mode, Shoutmon DX, Ludomon's line and RagnaLordmon
* It to release sometime before 2025
* Overworld encouters like Next Order
* Maybe an Open or Semi-Open Digital World to Explore
* Unique and interesting Side Quests
* A much smaller gap in power between stat-piercing moves and regular ones
* More digimon to get secondary moves like how Wargreymon had Terra Force and Brave Tornado
* Maybe some character creation (although I'm a little on the fence about this one)
* The ability to give your digimon accessories and change your character's clothes",1677290629.0

This game could be much better with some shader modifications

here is my personal thoughts as well as recapping at least episode 51 to 64,2,11arsrj,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/11arsrj/here_is_my_personal_thoughts_as_well_as_recapping/,0,"(please note I am only going to be skipping up to 52 and 55 for not really doing much other than basically be a lot more character development as well as most of the Week episodes but other than being good episodes and I do enjoy some of the concepts but didn't really feel like there's much bringing you on the table as well as more typical monster of the week)

I am making the recap  separate from the review because it was going to be a bit of a long one

&#x200B;

episode:  51 DarkKnightmon went on a rampage for his head and warping evolutions ( personally I would say it was a good episode but I don't really do much to me other than introducing warping evolutions)

(skip episode 52 to 55)

episode 56: this is where I feel like a show got interesting again. it's basically Kuzuhumon wanting to basically make the world pure again saving taking away the humans free will or something like that and also the Mega Evolution Siriusmon ( I feel likehonestly all about this design and really cool design and everything gun sword and pretty much just looking like basically he wants to be Omegamon's personal bodyguard) one Digimon

episode 57: kind of going with an ominous foreshadowing of of one Digimon but that will be for latest

episode 58: the ancientSphinxmon wants to bring back his ruler I basically turning somebody into still unblocks to build a pyramid to to bring his sarcophagus and resurrect him and also the new Mega evolution Diarbbitmon ( I would say the design does remind me a lot of sakuyamon how it basically is more of a human wearing armor that's more similar to his previous forms and fulfilling his more wanting to become a knight)

episode 59: oh yes let's rip off Jiraiya from Naruto ( yes I know Jiraiya is before Naruto and everything and as well as the inspiration for the character version but still) also hello everyone's Gulus here to do your basically you're going to straight up Kill Jiraiya but instead you survived also later adopt adopted by basically one of employees members coworkers ( included growlmon cameo)

episode 60: someone was dealing with Batman the drowned ( if you don't know it's basically a female Bruce Wayne ends up basically becoming me queen of Atlantis) basically a digimon really wants to flood the entire city also a new form Mega Evolution Amphimon (it does look a bit more like this if a big daddy ( from BioShock) in the modern day female Edition. although I see people for the kind of comparing to king gainer but I haven't seen it yet and maybe I'll give it some point in summary lightning let's go back yeah you just right okay let's make it look yeah so yeah so)

episode 61: that's going to be one of the darker episodes of the show so far ( hope the dude see some therapy as well as how to get a new girlfriend after what he just witnessed and let go of his dead lover) and also Moon=Millenniummon but he'll be important for later

episode 62: the haunted apartment building ( turns out this is supposed to be a refuge house for Digimon apparently) and also clearing up that real Hiro ( which is the only thing that tells holding Espimon for pretty much the longest period of time for being a like character. and I do feel like a moments you don't really do much during points but still helped out) also it's not that surprising that Tamer I can have more than one Digimon ( look at Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth or appmon)

episode 63: Ruli become a Big eater but it turns out she got possessed as well as many other humans by a a digimon who basically still human life energy for the young Digimon and also more Digimon is coming to the human world ( wait what-)

episode 64: for about guys later this is the first time we didn't have any narration about the holographic ghost ( then again to be fair it also kind of reuses a lot of that's how early episodes) anyways the actual episode is about humans getting possessed ( but this time by a voice calling them) and turning into fish people ( well I wouldn't say that's impossible I mean have you not listening seen heavy weather's subliminal messages) caused by digimon's equivalent to a Cthulhu I remind a lot of Cthulhu ( I really need my to Cthulhu blade at some point) although some of the main protagonists have been protected ( because obvious) by the way why didn't we just use earplugs and what about deaf people.

anyways managed to defeated and as well as steal the way by  Cythllamon and his army helping the humans.  JOSHU nice to see you again and Hiro’s dad finally comes back to the human world. ( with that other way I think the show is done for now we can finally get on with our lives and awesome moment.)

with that other way I think we're done with the show and everything else and all the Happy Endings--

\*see the power and Wi-Fi going down\*

I sure Japan already has a plan about that just in case but all seriousness the situation shows seriousness this year the steaks are really high and the end is coming

&#x200B;

  although I would say it has been quite interesting after episode 55 and I can't wait for the final three episodes ( kind of wish they did last a bit longer but okay)

Also, for the sake of recognition, every character is going to be associated with their Digimon partner for the title screen, potential story, and intro animation. So Tai and Agumon would be their intro before digivolving into Greymon, the Frontier gang would either scan like the show (for bonus, they could have the silhouettes of their ""rookie"" forms)

Digimon and computer science.,34,119kovq,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/119kovq/digimon_and_computer_science/,10,"Something that has always bothered me is that Digimon doesn't take advantage of its backstory. Some versions make an effort, such as Tamers and the fact that the D-Reaper is based on the actual first computer virus and anti-virus, for one, but mostly they just go the easy 'fantasy' route. Nothing wrong with that, but c'mon, they're DIGITAL monsters!

For comparison, a while back, pokemon collaborated with a museum in Japan where they compared their fossil pokemon with the real extinct animals they were based on. Wouldn't it be cool if Digimon did a similar thing, but with like, say, the history of computer science? Like Agumon Hakase and Terriermon Assistant walking you through the work of Charles Babbage, through the Astanaoff-Berry Computer and ENIAC (which were both referenced in the Brave Tamer WonderSwan game), the advent of home computers and the internet, etc.

If they REALLY don't want to let go of the fantasy stuff, here's a fun fact -- the inventor of modern binary code,  Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, was a major Sinophile and based the system on I Ching divination. And if you want to get into tin-foil hat territory, I Ching has a set of 64 hexagrams, and many current computers run on 64-bit operating systems. Eh? EHHHH?

Do you want a Ghost Game sequel?,9,118dqal,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/118dqal/do_you_want_a_ghost_game_sequel/,33,"Ghost Game is officially ending VERY soon. Obviously, there are still quite a few plots that need to be finished in a very short amount of time. So a lot of people are assuming there will be a sequel...

Do you want a Ghost Game sequel?

Personally, I *do* want a Ghost Game sequel because Hiro, Ruli, Kiyo, and everyone else deserves to really be explored much more than they were explored in Ghost Game. Characters like Espimon, Ryudamon, and most of the Digimon and human side characters deserve way more screentime and development than they were given. They're very charming, but they're also really flat as they are now. They were all set up fairly well, but there's no way there can be any follow through with how little time is left. GulusGammamon especially deserves a *year's worth* of screentime, but he's presumably only going to get around 6 or 7 episodes of time.

At the same time though, I feel like Ghost Game doesn't *deserve* a sequel and hasn't set itself up for a sequel. It had more than enough time to finish the stories it set up (Where's Weedmon, Piedmon, Phelesmon, and why was Dracmon killed off so stupidly?). It had more than enough time to explore the characters and let them develop. It had more than enough time to lay out and solve all the mysteries it has, but its pacing was way too messy to give anyone the time they deserved. I don't know if the writers were screwed over by Toei or something, or if they were just too ambitious, but I feel like Ghost Game could have comfortably been finished in 50 episodes with much better pacing and focus. 

If there really is a sequel, it will probably take a long time to actually come out, and they would probably have to add in a bunch of new crap to make it worth being a show (though I guess they could do something like a 6-part series like Tri). They could make a movie instead, but that's not a good idea when it's taken them over a millennium to tell us that the 02 movie does indeed *exist.* A Ghost Game movie would probably come out at the same time as a real life Gammamon hologram.

I want a sequel, but it's really frustrating that a sequel can even be considered for a show that could have ended neatly. Then again, most Digimon shows have really rushed endings so...At least Ghost Game's not the first show to mess up its climax (Runaway Locomon, I'm looking at you)...Or maybe I'm wrong and the next couple of episodes will be the greatest conclusion to anything ever.

Do you want a GG sequel? If you DO want a sequel, what do you think it should be called?

2.) If that's impossible, will my work clearing Stage 15 on my particular Dim cards be recognized by the BE — i.e., if I cleared Stage 15 with those cards on the Digivice V, could I get to Omnimon Zwart with the first egg I hatch from those Dim cards on the BE?

Magnamon (Blue) Custom Figure,52,117vh2v,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/117vh2v,12,"I bought two standard Magnamon Figure-rise Figures. One to display as regular Magnamon and the other to show Magnamon if he was a standard mega digivolution much like Rapidmon’s ultimate form (green). I decided to put him in Blue armor instead of gold. 

I know many people have probably recolored Magnamon to look like a standard level version of himself instead of an armored digimon (personally I think Magnamon would be a mega level digimon instead of an Ultimate like rapidmon green) 

Anywho. I hope you guys like what I did. It's extremely rough, but this is my first repaint of a model of this scale. I really liked how he came out though

Digimon OCs and Their Canon Counterparts. Goin' Together Like Oil and Water.,3,117r89h,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/117r89h/digimon_ocs_and_their_canon_counterparts_goin/,4,"So not too long ago I was asking around about fanfiction - and if that ain't your thing, tag out now - and was specifically asking about things that are either original from the ground up, versus those that are based on anime or other worlds from the games and such. And one question I had was particularly when it comes to OCs in relation to canon characters.

OCs are sort of the most divisive things in fanfiction. People either vehemently hate them, or they can respect them. Mainly because OCs are the simplest thing to get wrong and the hardest thing to get right - especially when it comes to protagonist characters. Even more controversial, is when those characters are shipped with canon characters as well.

I bring this up because I had the idea of doing a fic that had an OC protagonist character, but touched upon or involved different characters from the franchise, especially due to the recent anniversary. However, I understand that many people wouldn't wanna read a fic about some newbie they'd never heard of, and would want to see the characters they're already familiar with. Conversely, however, one could argue that those official characters obviously exist in their original works, so why not see newer characters as opposed to those older ones, when you could just go back to watch the original product to see those older characters?

It really is a balancing act, if that weren't clear enough. Hence, I felt the need to just reach out to check some general pet peeves, easy ways to avoid issues, things of that accord based on your own experiences, either from good examples, or things that were so bad you wonder how the author couldn't have caught the obvious problems.

Context, he's been sad that none of his friends know Digimon. He asked why they don't. And they Digimon isn't as popular as Pokémon.

It’s no coincidence that he pops up and all of a sudden the Digital World disappears. I have two theories, maybe a third. 

One: Hokuto’s an incompetent scientist meddling with things he should not be, giving out free, one-way tickets to the real world for who knows what reason. 

Two: Everything that has happened has all lead up to this point, as planned by Hokuto, with Gammamon growing enough to have reached his Mega-level stage consistently, and he’s planning to do something incomprehensible with Gulusgammamon/Regulusmon/Arcturusmon. 

Three: Being in the Digital World for so long, Hokuto could have either fallen to corruption by some deeply evil Digimon or teamed up with said Digimon for scientific purposes. 

Alas, I doubt it’d be any of the three, with how surprising the reveal of the Digital World disappearing is, the writers got something juicy planned.",1676827766.0

Back to Greek mythology I think an episode based on the recent Achillesmon. I could also see something about Hercules/Herakles either as a new Digimon or as a human character with his own partner Digimon, he would then fight Digimon like Hydramon and Cerberumon.",1676772725.0

[Vital Bracelet] Battle Success rate and Transferring DiMs,1,115lm5y,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/115lm5y/vital_bracelet_battle_success_rate_and/,8,"I had a couple of questions about the Vital Bracelet if anyone might know the answers, sorry if this is a little long.

At the moment I'm using the Impulse City DiM and have raised Kazuchimon with max Vital Values and have been working through the Adventure missions, but 3 or 4 times in a row I've failed at Stage 13 against Shivamon, while pretty much every other battle I do results in a win. I was wondering if a Digimon's attribute contributes to their success rate, as Kazuchimon is a Vaccine and Shivamon is Data, which would put me at a disadvantage. If this the case, would it make sense to store Kazuchimon away for now and raise Achillesmon for the advantage? I plan to raise all 4 Megas so I would eventually be doing this anyway. Also, if I store my current Digimon, does this reset the Adventure mission progress? In which case, I'd be better off just continuing as is and hoping to get lucky next time.

My 2nd question concerns the Vital Bracelet BE. I'm currently using the vanilla VB and Impulse City is my first DiM, but it was recently announced that the BE is getting an official release here in the UK, so I'm tempted to upgrade when it's released, as I don't want to miss out on some of the BE exclusive DiMs that have been announced going forward. I believe that the BE has no limit on using DiM cards on multiple devices, but does this apply to DiMs already registered on a non-BE Bracelet? I can take the loss of Impulse City if so, but wouldn't want to register any other DiMs on this device before getting a BE in that case.",1676744468.0

dubbed tamers thoughts spoilers,0,115gxc0,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/115gxc0/dubbed_tamers_thoughts_spoilers/,4,"just finished tamers and what a ride.

starting it was fun but felt like standard digimon. I enjoyed rikas development she wears a broken heart t-shirt for most of the show then wears a heart t-shirt showing how she is complete nice touch.

odd how guilmon ultimate and mega and same with terriermon had  bad looking cgi animation but renamon still had nice 2d animation for digivolving. I liked the music for biomerging 

the movie island of Adventurers was ok felt like an extended episode nothing special.

i enjoyed the deva arc and leomon 😔 draper jeri was freaky.

in the dub she said her mum died and she treated her stepmother badly is it same in sub ? 

they made jeris dad a douche due to him leaving jeri and not helping her when she retired from the digital world is he like that in sub.

i liked the meta that digimon 01 and 02 are TV shows in the tamer world.

i also enjoyed impmons arc even if he was forgiven quiet fast. but he had a cool remdeption.

i like the idea that jangu gang created the digimon but then revealed they were already there but the monster makers helped the digimon expand which further triggered the d reaper.

when kai appeared he sounded like Davis then in next scene had a surfer dude accent lol.

the ending was emotional but the reveal of the portal and the TV movie does kinda take away a bit from the emtional ending as we know they will see each other again granted if you didn't know about the TV movie it could be an ambiguous ending. 

but Henry not forgiving his dad 😔.

not sure why marineangemon didn't dedigivolve from mega. 

overall I really enjoyed the whole show even in dub. 

the locomon movie was good but took away a bit from the ending of the show as I mentioned. especially as the digimon were already in the real world with no explationantion. unless this movie takes place after d reapers defeat but before they all go back to the digital world ?

kinda like last evolution kizuna emtional ending is undone due to the release of 02 the beginnings.",1676731704.0

Sometimes the toy just resets itself after some shakes, bringing me back to the Digimon selection screen and sometimes it just freezes and I have to reset it by moving the batteries out and in again.

What if Tai had a Betamon instead?,11,114o3pp,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/114o3pp/what_if_tai_had_a_betamon_instead/,8,"Agumon is pretty much the main mascot of the franchise, and I believe this is due to 2 factors: Agumon being a Rookie in the very first V-Pet and due to this, being chosen as Tai's partner Digimon in the Adventure anime. This not only catapulted Agumon into being the face of the Digimon franchise but also started the trend of dinosaur and dragon Digimon being associated with the main heroes of each series (fan-favourite Guilmon in particular is stated to be inspired in-universe by Agumon).

But the V-Pet had another choice of Rookie; Betamon. So I'm curious, what if they gave Tai a Betamon instead? What impact would this have had on the series? Would it have affected the choice of the other Chosen Children's partners? What would its line have been? What other changes to the anime would have happened? And how would it affect the franchise as a whole? Would sea serpents become the primary ""main character"" Digimon instead of dinosaurs? Would Guilmon end up a completely different Digimon? What other outcomes would this one change have caused?

These are the questions that keep me up at night.",1676647192.0

Potential for a new Urdu dub of Digimon Adventure (1999),2,114iggw,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/114iggw/potential_for_a_new_urdu_dub_of_digimon_adventure/,0,"Hi Everyone

So there's this kids channel in Pakistan called Kids Zone (email: info@kidzoneplus.com) who have previously expressed interested in dubbing Digimon, and have even been offered the rights to do so by Toei.

However there was some miscommunication and essentially what it boils down to is, the main negotiation was for Dragonball and that fell through because of unrelated reasons.

However! That means Digimon is still totally available for them to dub! The quality of their dubs is so amazing, especially when compared to the original Hindi dubs we all grew up with, and they make a point of dubbing insert songs in all of their programmes.

We never had that before, and only had ONE instance of dubbed Hindi Butter-Fly which is now lost media.

This is a really fantastic opportunity for a whole new generation to fall in love with Digimon in an area of the world which doesn't get a whole lot of love and attention.

If you guys wouldn't mind dropping these guys an email, and just briefly stating how good a product Digimon would be for them, it could really galvanise them to go for the rights properly this time, rather than an afterthought.

Please tell any Digimon fan you know to do the same!",1676634368.0

I tried to play it completely blind aside from the saving/loading cheats cause I wanted some decent affinity raise for battle purposes.

I got the highest morality percentage with harmony and wrathful being the second and last. So I thought for certain that I’m on the Moral route, I even got Agumon’s normal evolution line up until his Mega, I ended up getting his Harmony evolution, which I don’t mind, but I didn’t realized that I ended up in the harmony route, despite that my moral level is still the highest. When does the game determine which path/ending you’ll end up in, I’m assuming its after we got back from the real world?

Since the final boss a virus and my Mega is a data I’ve been having a hard time fighting it, my digimon kept getting one shoted. Is this an impossible fight, am I stuck? Am I gonna force myself to play the super easy mode to beat the final boss?

Just finished Digimon Savers/Data Squad,66,113o9jd,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/113o9jd/just_finished_digimon_saversdata_squad/,33,"Me and my homie continue our journey to go through all the digimon seasons and movies

We just finished Digimon Savers. Ngl, it doesn't deserve the bad rep people gave it. There are genuinely good characters and stories in the season. Masaru, Thoma, Ikuto are all amazing characters that have fleshed out personalities.

Masaru may seem hot headed and viloent at times but is honestly soft at heart which can be seen how he treats Ikuto when Masaru brings him home. His realization that he is not a one man army, it's through Agumon can he truly take control of the dangerous situation that the other digimon presents and vice versa for agumon. Be it god, human or a Digimon, your actions and carry weight and what you do and not do carry consequences that can't be avoided. A ""TRUE MAN WOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS ACTIONS AND STAYS TRUE"" as he would say.

Thoma showing signs of jealousy when he saw Masaru alive mom and healthy sister. Later treating chika (Masaru's little sister) kindly and Masaru's mother kindly, especially after their hospitality. There was a whole episode where Thoma wanted to take them out for the plan ever because it was Chikas Birthday. It was honestly adorable. Later revealed how he still feels guilty for his own mother death, how he would stand infornt a oncoming truck just to save her. How in his toxic family, it has his weak sister that was his becon of light. It was to save her that he took up medicine. The frustration and hate he felt for his father who wouldn't stand up for Thoma or his late wife, the indecisiveness of his father that led to Thomas hate for the rest of his family. Thoma had a interesting rival villain that kinda dropped the ball but the idea was there.

Ikuto a humon child with a digimon heart. An interesting character, separated with his parents as a baby and raised by a digimon. He ended his losing digimon mother to a human. He grew to hate humans. It was through his interaction to Masaru and the gang to finally see that humans aren't evil as he thought. Him going to the human world, how alien he felt and further increased when he wanted by both humans and then even digimon. How he ended up taking this positively and deciding to become a bridge that would allow for a world digimons and humans could live in peace.

The BIGGEST issue I have with the season is Yoshino

She is set up as a character with an inferiority complex. Her mother is a amazing piano player, her sisters are told to us as also talented. And that she was always the one who screwed up. She paired with 2 talented kids. Masaru who just showed up to the team and already he's doing a great job and Thoma the child prodigy. But like she.......never does anything or has an issue with this. Her rival villains are usually comical and she never really had any growth. The only time she gets something like this was the episode where she gets her perfect evolution but that honestly felt like tokenism. She later paired with Ikuto alot but that kinda feels like she's tagging along. Overall Yoshino is a character that wasn't used at all.

There were a few issues here and there but I found the final royal knights arc felt rushed kinda weird, and how they were setting up Masaru's dad as the second coming of jesus but that's fine, it got the job done.


The story still holds up, a good villain, character progression is pretty good (except you Yoshino). Overall pretty entertaining",1676546265.0

Adventure 02 Reboot,4,1147w10,digimon,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/1147w10/adventure_02_reboot/,14,"If we were to get an adventure 2 reboot then what is one thing you guys would want.

For me its the evolution of the new generation digidestined. While the armor evolution and Jogress evolution were ok, I felt that one of the problems is that they required either an item or another partner. To me this almost the same thing as what happened in digimon adventure 1 where Tai and Matt were the only ones to reach mega, while the others reached (mostly Takeru) ultimate level. I know that the whole point was the dark towers preventing them from achieving champion level, and that armor evolution a strong bypass to them. The same thing as well when it came to jogress evolution. 

So my take is that in the reboot Davis, Yolei, Cody, and Ken will still have the same champion level evolution, but after that they should have new ultimate and mega digimon evolution minus Ken since he would get banchostingmon later on

Although it might be for the best to make those four the main characters while takeru and Hikari are secondary characters since they already achieved mega by the end of the digimon adventure 2020 reboot. Or at least have them coach the new generation",1676599730.0

One of the things that bothers me when playing the dungeon is the second area, before the Malo boss fight. When arriving at the pits that have hovering platforms, they don't appear, which makes the pit uncrossable. I figured out this is caused by 2 situations:

\- before defeating Malo, if you have a colored item either equipped or carried in the inventory.

\- after defeating Malo, when the dungeon is revisited, regardless of difficulty and having or not having any colored items. (this means if you play on NG+ with a Mega, you won't be able to go to the boss area).

Only Virus Lab has this. It doesn't happen in Electro Mine.

My favorite has always been the Kabuterimon line, and seeing H-Kabuterimon as a secreted excited me but also made it frustrating.

Well I finally did it and I love seeing him in game. I think I can finish the game with him. (I'm running a patched version that has some QoL features, like being able to use any type in specific locations)",1664224265.0
Digimon World 1 - Are you locked into an evolution before it actually happens?,5,xa9gcu,DigimonWorld,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigimonWorld/comments/xa9gcu/digimon_world_1_are_you_locked_into_an_evolution/,6,"Hey guys,

I have a Leomon that dies within 1 hour of loading my save. I wanted to save it because I'd only been training with it, thinking I would surely get my 3rd ultimate in a row if I did so. Turned out, as with how DW1 works, of course that wasn't correct. My stats were just slightly skewed towards... well, not going up to Ultimate.

So I decided to check the 'evolution tool' made by SydMontague (thanks a bunch for your hard work!) despite my initial intention being to let me get what I get... I'd already broken that rule by un-Numemon-ing my Elecmon (the rules of thumb I found and used that worked to not get the turd from Agumon, did unfortunately not work for Elecmon).

According to the evo tool, my defense was a bit too low for Andromon, the rest was all where it needed to be or much higher. Weight was also too low. So I forcefed it to get the weight up, then scolded it a couple times to get the discipline back to 100%. It still died (the defense could be neglected with the discipline bonus requirement).

Decided to try out cheat engine for the first time in forever, narrowed down which values would change the stats, weight and even the lifespan and battle count. Even if I change all stats to 600/6000, battle count to 60, weight to 40 (should be between 35 and 45), Leomon still dies. The values do take effect - brains are officially at 477, if I change them to 500 and I enter battle, I can give specific move commands.

Leomon also still dies if I change the lifespan to 240 and praise him, or 359 or 360 and let the clock roll over to the next hour.

So... I can't help but think that no matter what one would do, even if you would fairly obtain the correct requirements, your digimon will still die if you only manage to get to the requirements 1 hour or so before the death. Because no matter what I try, Leomon seems to be locked into death and nothing is changing that... that's odd, isn't it?

True, I have not found the care mistakes value in cheat engine to tamper with that, but I'm 99% sure that I have 0 mistakes. Maybe 1 tops? And it should be under 5 for Andromon, so still should not be a problem.

I don't get it. The forcefeeding and scolding it should be enough - no cheating needed. But even when I cheat it doesn't work.",1662765023.0

Digimon World PSX (Emulated) Yuramon dialogue glitching?,2,qtwqyb,DigimonWorld,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigimonWorld/comments/qtwqyb/digimon_world_psx_emulated_yuramon_dialogue/,0,"So i booted up original Digimon World 1, and got INCREDIBLY lucky over and over. Got greymon first try, learned Magma Bomb, Dynamite Kick, and Heat Laser back to back, have good stats (2500hp, 2000mp, 300 Off, 200 Def, 200 Speed, 250 Brains), went through all the early game things (Palmon, Kunemon, fought Drimogemon/Carried Dirt, Elecmon shop, etc.. and I've went up to the invisible bridge where you go ""whoah dangerous"" but it refuses to trigger Yuramon's dialogue to tell you about the invisible walk-way. I used a glitch (enter from overdell hold right and up at same time, pause right  before first footstep, unpause) that lets you just run over the bridge; then did Monochromon's quest, got to freezeland etc.. and it STILL won't change Yuramon's dialogue.   


TL:DR = Yuramon glitched won't change dialogue even after making it to Freezeland using exploits to bypass bridge. Would rather not restart an incredibly lucky run and a lot of grinding i'll have to redo just to fix this. Anyone heard of this, have an answer?

So......... i had this game for a long time and just barely started playing and im still getting my footing. Watched a lot of yourube videos to help me with some stuff but, LORDT! I messed up. 

Okay, im on my 4th gen digimon and finally got aome ultimates :D (Megadramon and Metalgreymon Blue) SADLY i messed up and couldnt get decent enough stats to progress past the Machinedramon fight in Server Desert. I saw a reddit post with the guard skill. I learned that the gym is just NOT IT, so im trying to buff my stats through battles but i hit a point where the places i should train give me like NO STATS and anything higher that should be easier (like, where i have to use maybe 1 item) are impossible. 

My digimon are 15 days old so theyre probably going to die soon, so im thinking of just waiting till then to do the training i figured out but in the meantime i need help. Im tired of soft resetting and i know if i just train these digimon in the gym theyre just gonna peace out. This is the longest ive had my partner digimon so far with average dying after 10 or so days (probably because of the gym) 

Im looking for a decent training spot to buff my stats and get past this damn storyline. Ill be better i promise 😭

TLDR; i fucked up and my ultimates are weak. Trying to pass storyline but best training spots online give me no stats and places that should he easier are impossible.",1616369716.0
