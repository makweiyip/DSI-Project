if youre find play pokemon a bite too easy heres something ive be do to spice it up a bite more,if youre find play pokemon a bite too easy heres something ive be do to spice it up a bite more so ive be play pokemon a long time pretty much as long as theres be pokemon ive be play it ive be impose a self set of rule because of both how easy pokemon be especially once you know the trick and because of a few things ive notice skip this paragraph if you just want the rulesbut one thing ive notice when i play pokemon game be that i always end the game with so much money and so much heal items and i start to think about why i think that be able to walk back to a pokemon center and heal be too convenient so nobody ever waste their super potion on a route or in a gym when they can just go back to the pokemon center and spend a grand total of second heal all their mons and get back to the spot they be at before the only time the player be really push be if they be in cave but modern cave really dont hold up to og cave like mt silver rby victory road rse victory road even mt moon say what you will about mt moon but i have vivid childhood memories of get lose and feel like it take forever to navigate but since nothing ever stop the player from just head back to the pc whenever a large chunk of the game like heal items and even money have less of an impact alright sorry for the exposition heres the rule i use when i play pokemon game just to add a little spice once you enter a routegymhideout you may not leave that routegymhideout through the same way you come in you have begin a journey forward go somewhere that isnt where you come from this mean no casual walk back to the pokemon center when your st mon get poison by bug catcher arnies weedle or whatever save before you enter a routegymhideout if you black out on the route reload the save black out no punishment aside from lose a trivial amount of money that you werent go to spend anyway reload the save mean have to refight all the trainers now there be stake its like a gentle nuzlocke this mean that you need to actually prepare for your journey down the next route by buy and use heal items no avoid wild battle via run away or repel i think that be able to avoid wild pokemon remove the struggle and adventure aspect of journey down a route to the next town the journey wasnt memorable because you avoid everything except two trainers but when you have to battle every wild mon and your pp be run out and the wild mons keep whittle your health down and toss the occasional status effect thats when you feel the struggle the danger the adventure of it all make it to the next city with one paralyze pokemon leave at hp now that be a memorable journey set mode on i feel like this doesnt need explain but be able to always switch to a water type when you know a fire type be come be hella cheat cod if anyone complain about how easy the game be but play with switch mode on you deserve to get turn into a shedinja without wonder guard no use free heal on rout this one be a bite minor but some game have the convenient nurse right outside the cave who heal all your pokemon dont use it or if you think thats a bite harsh cause sometimes they have a long route follow by a nurse before a cave and then another route after the cave then just limit yourself to once per route these be some rule that add some fun to my playthroughs feel free to comment yours id love to read them nuzlockes arent the only way to play some difficult pokemon,1

why dont we have reverse eevee it would be such a cool mechanic,why dont we have reverse eevee it would be such a cool mechanic we now have multiple pokemon that can evolve into a few different evolutions with eevee be the most well know example however we be now nine generations in and still havent get the inverse a pokemon that can evolve from multiple preevolutions think about how cool of a mechanic this could be in the game as a type for the stage normal would probably be the best fit but parallel to eevee the preevolutions could be all sort of type the preevolutions could all have different abilities and movesets that the stage could inherit that would leave you with an incredibly customizable pokemon where you have no clue what to expect when face it until it actually attack i can only see two issue with this and both would be pretty easy to fix when breed evolve pokemon the baby become the unevolved form in this case with multiple unevolved form simply have the baby decide by ability as those should still be able to be trace back to the basic form the parentpokemon originally evolve from it could be kinda weird for the trade card game in the trade card game a stage card usually have mark what pokemon it evolve from and there be only room for one on the card not a flawless solution but you could simply not mark it on the card and instead give each of the basics an ability that basically say you can evolve that pokemon onto this pokemon this count as an evolution last part be important because the tcg have some special rule of when you can evolve the variable attack very similar solution use an ability as well this pokemon can use attack from its preevolutions it still need to fulfill the energy requirements sorry if the formulation feel off english isnt my native language so the trade card i have also dont have their word in english this work quite well since the tcgs abilities be quite different from the game in a lot of occasion anyway so it wouldnt matter that those wouldnt be abilities in the game,1

zerochanhttpspreviewreddituearngrutmapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledsaadaddbcdcaedffd so hoppip be suppose to represent a seed but i express how it kind of make no sense that it be pink and cat like i still think it make little to no sense especially when sunkern be just a few line down what they do wrong with hoppip they do right with sunkern i think sunkern be such an adorable concept its a little sunflower seed like look at it it look like its have a good time and im here for it its such a cool concept that im glad that they do right i actually have a shiny one of these i cant remember if i evolve it or not but its name pandora and i be hunt it on a mirage island on oras she may be a sunflora now i cant really remember v overall id put sunkern in the b rank i think its a super fun concept that they pull off really well i wish theyd take these simple ideas and make them into pokemon like back then i feel like sometimes they go too complex with design lately that they lose out on the charm like where be my dust bunny pokemon im wait game freak sunflora xb art by pokedump on tumblrhttpspreviewredditutrnbvtmapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledseecefabdcdc while i really like sunkern i actually dont like sunflora nearly as much which be a shame because sunflowers be my favorite flower i love sunflowers and feel like they could have do this pokemon really well but they just didnt and its not even the simplicity of it you can make design simple and still work sunflora just lack sunkerns cheer i think theres just something off about it honestly i wish they look more like the adorable sunflowers in mario sunshine i adore those things when id play that game but sadly despite the really good start and my bias for sunflowers sunflora still just lack c which suck i do like the minigame in sv when there be like run around you though that be fun c yanma xb art by decy on twitterhttpspreviewredditgeiyxlvtmapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledsfeffcfaaaeced for a dragonfly pokemon yanma have a really super interest design i thing its aesthetically nice to look at it and pokemon stay pretty loyal to the behavior of an actual dragonfly see these pokemon move in the d model be really fun because of how erratic they fly while i think these little bugger be adorable they do lack a certain something to them i havent ever hear of them be use for competitive or even during normal playthroughs even with an add evolution later on it doesnt seem to help this line at all which just sort of leave them abandon in the useless bug category c which suck because theyre so cute and interest i love dragonflies but yeah overall ill have to put yanma in c wooper xb cona_ on twitterhttpspreviewredditnfkbyhhwtmapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledsfdbbafcffbaefdfb lookie at the little wopper whoop i mean whooper defiinitely dont need to mistake those v but yeah its the little axolotl bean i love wooper look at its dopey little smile if you werent aware already i enjoy pokemon that loo like theyre happy to be alive woopers just a happy little dude and i adore this huggable bean woopers also pretty memorable to me for a long time wooper be the longest masuda hunt i ever do i be well over the ks and be struggle hardcore with maintain the drive to keep go coincidentally i have see a video of an albino exolotl and show my best friend the video express that it look like a shiny wooper my best friend know i be drive myself nut with the hunt make an off hand comment about how i didnt have one and i immediately get one as soon as she send the message in honor of the albino axolotl in the video my shiny woopers name ripley uwu but yeah woopers just a cute and adorable bean with an interest and unique design that lead into one of the in my opinion one of the best gen pokemon to use in game woopers definitely a a pokemon paldean wooper i actually use a paldean wooper in my playthrough of sv and ill be honest im not the biggest fan i prefer the og wooper c its just not as much of a huggable bean c quagsire xb art by berlin lopez on tumblrhttpspreviewredditomnpfytmapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledsabbdddbdcdbeacaefcd so ill start off the bat that i adore pokemon that can completely evade their weaknesses just because of their unique type or abilities i know that quagsire be x weak to grass but im always so interest in the fact that its grind type can completely evade the electric weakness it would have if it be just water i remember berthas quagsire throw me off so much in diamond and pearl visually also i just love this pokemon it fall into the its just happy to be alive and so i cant hate it ive never use a quagsire in a game but i wish i could its such a fun little dude i also have a shiny one of these with a less interest story than ripley but its always fun to have a complete line in the shiny live dex the only complaints i really have about quagsire be the x weakness to grass while also just be a little bland like i have no complaints but i also wouldnt complain if there be a little more visually to the pokemon i still love quagsire though and im more than okay with put it in a paldean quagsire i use one in my playthrough and im not gonna lie i wasnt a fan i felt like the pokemon wasnt tanky enough to live long enough and there be just better options in this region that make it less likely to use although it be the only reason why i beat eri when i have to poison stall her annihliape regardless this pokemons go in the d rank i just i dont vibe as well with the paldean form of this mon day espeon xb art by ohsweetssweetie on tumblrhttpspreviewredditooyqtwemztmapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledsfddebecdfadddadecd xb i love espeon so much its an adorable little psychic cat do anybody expect anything different espeons as adorable as it be powerful but the biggest reason for love come from pokemon colosseum when the two pokemon you start off with be umbreon and espeon i remember become enamor with this badass psychic cat the moment i saw her in this game and she become a star player in my team while espeon isnt my favorite out of the eeveelutions its definitely in the top ive consider get match tattoo with my best friend of an espeonumbreon duo because even though it isnt my favorite i still like it enough that i wouldnt complain about match on with my bestie the only thing that i have to complain about when it come to espeon be that as more psychic type be introduce and more options be bring up the less need it be espeon just kind of become a token eeveelution which be a little upset but i guess on par for how eeveelutions work overall even if theyre important and well love they dont really live up to the love in term of be useful in battle i still think espeon be amaze though and i love that it get put in unite too a day umbreon xb art by ohsweetssweetie on tumblrhttpspreviewredditvjhhclumapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledsfafacbfaefebfbdab while i adore umbreon i dont like them as much as i love espeon i can get behind the really cool and regal design but its far more dog like which isnt as appeal to my cat obsess heart for some reason look for fanart of umbreon unlock the memory more than espeon but i remember be young and on the internet and find videos online of dramatic love storeis between espeon and umbreon use deviantart inspire fanart to tell the stories of two eevees in love that be tear apart by something or other and evolve to save each other or something lol they be so cringey but i remember watch each and every one of them i could get my hand on as well as the cringey sonic ones but shhh this be a poke list but yeah regardless of cringey childhood bias i like umbreon for what it be but not as much as espeon it doenst help that i dont think its nearly as powerful as espeon so it get no pun intend overshadow i will admit that it have an awesome shiny though b day murkrow xb art by on deviantarthttpspreviewredditvkkoceumapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledsceeddfdfcdb honestly like hoothoot i feel like it wasnt hard to get this design right but they really do get this design right i love murkrows cute little witch hat add to the crow design its so creative and really add to the design its also hilarious that murkrow have the same catch rate as palkia for some reason like im so glad that this dumb bird be harder to catch than a literal time god its amazingly funny but make me groan anytime i need to catch a murkrow for my live dex which mean i normally have to catch two ugh but no i do like murkrow a lot ive never use this line and havent really have a huge drive to but the design be appeal enough to rank it at least above average too bad it have a dumb bright pink shiny c c slowking xb art by autobottesla on deviantarthttpspreviewredditbomwleumapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledscbddbcfbf slowking make me so embarrass aaaaa when i be play sv i so desperately want to use one on my team but i be really stupid and think that the line go slowpoke slowbrow slowking i completely forget that it be its own evolution and you need to evolve it a special way before it evolve int slowbro jdaklfjdsd i be so upset because i actually really like slowking a lot of it may be nostalgia with the pokemons major inclusion in the second pokemon movie i remember when i saw this pokemon on the tv i put it up on the same level as legendaries because it just seem super important im also a sucker for scarves and it look like slowking have one so visually i like it way more than slowbro id put slowking in the b rank galarian slowking nobody look the edge lord be here no but fr this thing be so goofy look i cant ever take it seriously slowking always give a sage vibe but galarian slowking just kind of look like a joke lmao d alright master post be do which mean im officially catch up let me know what you all think id love to hear it im so tire sobb anyway ill see ya

ice type should resist grind dragon and fly and do neutral damage vs water,ice type should resist grind dragon and fly and do neutral damage vs water i dont understand why ice have no resistances its sad that the only ice type viable pokemon be glass canon why pokemons like mamoswine be big and they should be resistant they should be tanky ice be hard ice be not an easy material to deal with xb you have to be though to resist in cold temperature so why every ice type pokemon be a chip that get obliterate easily xb okay you cant give em grass and bug resistance because grass and bug be already in a bad state xb but grind be a very strong type be super effective against fire rock steel poison and electric its wouldnt hurt to have ice resist it since its already a super effective type vs grind xb dragon because its already super effective vs dragon and dragon doesnt have many weaknesses its one of the strongest type so its not like a resistance to it would hurt xb fly because fly be only resist by steel and rock and be super effective against fight bug and grass and because i dont see bird have enough power to crush ice most bird cant stand the cold xb and for offense ice should do neutral damage vs water and the super effective damage should depend on the weather xb for example an ice type under a snowy weather would deal supereffective damage against water because the cold from the weather would help him to freeze the water xb and on the opposite side water pokemons under rain should be able to do super effective damage against ice pokemons since ice melt faster when you have many drop of room temperature weather xb that would make an interest use in the weather weather move would be more useful and interest if its could change the damage chart like this i know freeze dry and scald exist but its would be an addition to these move xb weather could also boost some passives like thick fat thick fat should be more effective under snow and on the opposite side under harsh sunlight thick fat isnt effective thats would make the game more strategic and weather would play a major role an effective type wouldnt be the only thing need to beat your opponent which would add more challenge xb rework of the freeze status xb freeze shouldnt be a paralysis like thunder wave or stun spore its should be more like a slow big speed reduction attack and attack spe reduction and defdef spe reduction the pokemon would still be able to act but he would be greatly disable which be the normal reaction of the body when youre in hypothermia youre not completely paralyze but youre clearly not in a great shape xb i think its important to make freeze different from paralysis because i dont see what the difference be i feel like paralysis be easier to place but the pokemon can still move sometimes which be weird and freeze be very hard to pull on but then its completely prevent the enemy pokemon from movingattacking make them different from each other would be nice xb and ice move should be super effective vs any freeze target no matter what type they have even if its a firesteel pokemon for example if its freeze the ice move should do super effective damage xb this way freeze become a very interest status if you manage to freeze your opponent hell have to cure his freeze otherwise youll be able to place super effective hit no matter his type xb or if you think its would be too op in that case we could only add a damage boost against freeze target for ice attack this way its wouldnt be too op but would still reward you for freeze your opponent xb what do you think about these change ice would become a nice powerful type with that set of move,1

what do you look for in a pokemon game aka what kind of pokemon player be you,what do you look for in a pokemon game aka what kind of pokemon player be you what it say on the tin what be it that you play or use to play pokemon for story gameplay exploration music competitive i start with pokemon gen silver so i get spoil right off the gate with a really dense contentrich experience as my first pokemon game which also shape my perspective on what a pokemon game should be an rpg game that open up the world to you to explore every little nook and cranny with lot of optional but engage content to indulge in as well as some nonlinear progression for you to customize your adventure let break down gen s progression style its linear up until ecruteak city after which you have the choice to go leave towards olivine and cianwood or right to mahogany and lake of rage both be require along with the rocket radio tower takeover to finish the game and you converge at blackthorn city for the final badge once you reach kanto in the postgame the entire region be open to you to complete in whatever order you desire minus the power plant sidequest to open up western kanto optional areas mean you dont even have to set foot in them one time to complete the game dark cave all three entrance ruin of alph and the second half of union cave whirl islands tin tower mt mortar rout below blackthorn city most of kantos rout and cave even moreso in hgss since cerulean cave and seafoam islands be restore the cave that be present here be all dense and multifloor labyrinthine and have puzzle to solve strength puzzle in some cave slide ice puzzle in ice path so with such a dense experience as my first game clearly an exploration heavy game this be what ive come to expect from every title id play after this i actually play gen red after silver and immediately felt the downgrade in term of quality of life and what not but it at least still offer that sense of exploration and nonlinear progression which start after you emerge from rock tunnel after the first three badge then i would play gen and it be underwhelming but still decent especially emerald with the battle frontier come off gen and its sheer content and feature richness go to gen and see all the remove feature for no apparent reason like day and night and animate pokemon from crystal and the radio and no second region to explore be what make it feel underwhelming to me but little do i know this be actually the start of the series remove feature every generation with no real reason as to why gen platinum be what i play be pretty nice as well and have plenty of nooks and crannies to explore and optional areas the postgame with the battle area felt like a miniregion on its own to explore since you could also do that in a nonlinear fashion gen black be what i play follow by white be where i start to notice the shift in the design philosophy of pokemon game since these be the most story focus game at the time they heavily sacrifice the ability to explore the region for this not only that but the map be a literal straight line to the pokemon league since the right half of the circle be close off until the postgame the areas do at least feel dense still and i do notice that all the optional section be behind the hms i dont think youre require to use an hm to get through the main game black and white be much the same but i be at least happy to see all the additional polish add to the presentation of these game everyone finally animate include all the generic trainers and even us if you be in a wifi battle against another player i fell off the series after this game though it wasnt until gen shield i play specifically that i try to returnand that be when i really realize that the game just dont really care about exploration anymore that be the most bore linear pokemon game ive play yet even more linear than gen which i didnt think be possible but what make it worse be that theres virtually no optional areas to explore in the game dlc not include only talk about the base game here compound with the fact that there be no longer any dungeons in the game either the only two cave in galar be both hallways and singlefloor the only dungeon if you can even call it that be also just an elevator ride i think it be at this point that i start to realize that pokemon be probably no longer a series about explore anymore and be just focus on whatever story they want to tell but be a gameplay first gamer that want to explore obviously i dont care about a pokemon story so none of the d title have appeal to me since,1

theory of evolution not quite what it seem,theory of evolution not quite what it seem so heres what perplex me greatly we have pokemon and we have humans there be reference to real world animals which make your presume animals that be not pokemon due exist in the pokemon world but in the show we also see very few examples probably because pokemon evolve from these creatures and we know that arceus know as a god level entity be consider a pokemon as we can capture its avatars we also know there be extradimensional alien that we can also capture as pokemon and not just in specialize ball but how long have arceus be around we know it be there and exist before the time of hisui and its say to have create everything but what exactly be a pokemon do humans which as primates come from the same evolutionary line as earth humans or be they just make as human why be humans immune to pokeballs we even see in hisui that the pokeballs dont have a human noncapture protocol program because tech be not of that level so humans be fundamentally not pokemon exceptwhen they be we see from many examples that people do become pokemon ie most ghost type which would mean that the possibility of the dna not be a pokemon but the human be there be also examples of humans become kadabras or even isekaid into it like the mystery dungeons so what make a pokemon what it be and how do humans rise to power in a world that isnt ours we do know that arceus enjoy battle like the eternal battle reverie in legends arceus but humans arent need to cause pokemon battle like wild creatures the battle can easily happen between species and we arent need to bring out the potential of a pokemon others evolve and grow in power without human interaction but it also come to the question we know that arceus be the pokemon god but be he our god do arceus create humans that part have always be obscure be that intentional be we immune to the pokemon affect because humans arent arceus children but something elses children maybe that be why humans have to either die or be transform into a pokemon bring me your thoughts source and theories,1

my idea for pokemon move even after ds online get completely shut down,my idea for pokemon move even after ds online get completely shut down while currently the talk be only about shut down the eshop i think it isnt really up to imagination if the ds online service get shut down but rather when and obviously this would completely shut down a lot in term of transfer gen to obviously work due to the dualcartridge dses and to work via a local transfer however to to as well as vc to as well as to further generations be completely block be bank inevitably someday shut down too xb so my proposal for this dilemma be the follow one thing i omit in the gen to description be that it be not purely a plain local transfer similar how gen to work but rather the ds with the gen game get a piece of software the pokeporter from the gen game via ds download play some people may remember that mario kart ds similarly allow multiplayer with several people who dont even own the game xb this technique also exist for the ds although i have no idea if or how much it be use however use this one could equally create a ds download play software that work similar to the pokeporter to move the pokemon but this time to pokemon home over a switch or possibly even mobile phone if the ds even allow instal of software via download play one could even go super creative and create a local pokemon box style system to move pokemon locally between the generations include vc game,1

be curse a one of a kind move,be curse a one of a kind move curse be either one of a kind or very rare that be a move that operate completely differently depend on which pokémon use it basically one move act like entirely different move when most pokémon use curse its a simple stat modifier but when a ghost type use it it sacrifice health in exchange for strong damage over time be there any other move like this yes i know there be some with minor differences but none i can think of that be basically different move entirely nothing else to say other than that its kinda cool that its one of a kind in this way and i never see anyone acknowledge that so show some respect to curse,1

the many origins of shiinotic an overly long analysis of the most underappreciated alolan pokémon tldr at the end,the many origins of shiinotic an overly long analysis of the most underappreciated alolan pokémon tldr at the end though some may find it forgettable shiinotic be my favorite pokémon of all time and im about to go over all the reason why through a reddit post of excruciate length alas shiinotic be not a very popular pokémon and its easy to see why a lot of people find it too creepy or uncanny to like especially compare to morelull most of its inspirations arent immediately obvious its never be feature prominently in any of the game and even in its first appearance it be horribly overshadow by nearly every other new grass and fairytype pokémon to my knowledge not one person have ever care enough about this freaky mushroomman to write a thorough analysis of its design its relevance to the alola region and just why it have the fairy type until today part mycological root first let take a moment to talk about its heartmeltingly adorable preevolution morelull an emptyeyed bioluminescent mushroom whose name come from morel a famous type of edible fungus and lull refer to how its spores can induce sleep hopefully you havent be pronounce it as morelull while morelull may sound innocuous merely feed on nutrients from tree root and soil to sustain itself and never stay in one spot so as not to cause more harm than it need to it have potential to be as deadly as any fairy pokémon the japanese sun and moon website speak of an incident wherein a morelull colonys spores fly into the vent of an airplane that be fly overhead put those on board to sleep and nearly cause a crash shiinotic be best describe as creepy cute its a taller more humanoid mushroom with the same hollow eye as morelull but the additions of a blank offputting smile and long green mycelium finger through which it drain the vitality of seemingly whomever it see fit make for one of the more unsettle fairytype pokémon or it could be describe as a cross between a toad from mario and the landlord from super milk chan dangerous as it may be its not completely cruel the anime show that shiinotic can also share energy with those they take a like to in a similar manner to how mycorrhizal fungi transfer nutrients from the soil to their botanic symbionts its name can be break down into shiitake a common edible mushroom that grow on decay wood shine refer to its ability to produce phosphorescent light and hypnotic reference the idea of put one to sleep through hypnotism the mindinfluencing psychoactive agents find within certain mushroom and how certain bioluminescent animals beguile prey with their mesmerize light in most languages shiinotics name pertain to mushroom and light in both japanese and korean it be mashade and its french name be lampignon which reveal that its line also take inspiration from night light lamps and lampshades the pokémon company directly acknowledge this in the promotional artwork for the snorlaxs yawn merchandise which depict a bedroom fill with all manner of pokémonthemed furniture include a shiinotic bedside lamp situate atop an aurorus dresser before go into any more detail about what could have inspire bowl pin toads appearance it would be wise to first explain its type grass be easy prior to the revelation that fungi dont actually photosynthesize they spend age be conflate with and incorrectly classify as plant as for fairy fairies have be associate with nature and therefore mushroom for almost as long as the idea of fairies have be a thing over time this have lead some lucky shrooms to be bestow with such monikers as dryads saddle and fairy inkcap as well as shroomish and breloom be place in the fairy egg group during a time when people make less distinction between medical science and magic the potential medicinal toxic or hallucinogenic properties of mushroom earn them a history of use in sorcery and shamanic rituals a trope that still persist in popular culture to this day in fantasy stories theyre often use as potion ingredients by wizards and witch funny enough shiinotics design can be read as a literal mushroom cloud erupt from a cauldron though its hard to say whether or not this be deliberate the mushroom most frequently depict in fairy stories and paint and arguably the most recognizable fungus of all be the poisonous and hallucinogenic amanita muscaria the redandwhite toadstool commonly know as the fly agaric you know the one sometimes its show be use as a seat or dwell by a fairy or gnome other time it be but one detail in an enchant forest fill with wonder it have since be adopt by popular culture as the goto look for a wild mushroom start with renaissance paint and work its way up through alice in wonderland to the smurfs to mario and minecraft to even pokémons fifth generation of game which use it as a basis for foongus and amoonguss some have also speculate the fly agaric to have religious connotations of vary level of plausibility from be the soma describe in ancient hindu texts to even be the forbid fruit consume by adam and eve in the garden of eden the amanita genus be best know for its poisonous species include some of the most toxic toadstools know to man while some be in fact safe to eat provide they be correctly identify others contain downright deadly level of toxins though shiinotic may not be poisonous lack the type and only learn one poisontype move it share some of the other trademark of mushroom in this genus include a wide convex cap cover in patch or warts and a volva thats the pink sacklike structure that form the lower part of shiinotics body a remnant of the universal veil that envelop the mushroom during its infancy in addition to amanita shiinotic be base on mycena fungi of which species be know to produce fairy fire fairy fire be one of the three name for the ethereal glow produce by chemical reactions within certain fungi on decay wood the others be foxfire and chimpanzee fire in particular shiinotics pink cap be reminiscent of species such as m rosella m pura and m purpureofusca if we branch out to other families an even closer match be the pink waxcap porpolomopsis calyptriformis while foxfireproducing fungi mainly emit it from the mycelium the fruitbody or both the slippery mycena roridomyces roridus specifically only have bioluminescent spores the anime show that this isnt true of morelull nor shiinotic but nevertheless their pokédex entries mainly describe their light as be emit from their spores likewise m pruinosoviscida be know to emit light from both fruitbody and spores other mycena species that may hold relevance here include m interrupta and m nargan also know as the pixies parasol and the spot pixie cap respectively as well as several species that go by variations of fairy helmet such as the bleed fairy helmet m haematopus all of this be of course a perfect fit for alola bioluminescent fungi be most common in temperate and tropical climates and hawaii be know as the rainbow state hence team rainbow rocket the prism pokémon necrozma miniors many color and the bedazzle bruxish hawaii be home to many species capable of produce light mostly aquatic animals and bacteria but also the fungus armillaria nabsnona whose mycelium be bioluminescent in general armillaria be better know as honey fungi for many of their species have yellow yellowishbrown or straightup brown cap that match up with shiny shiinotics such as a ostoyae a luteobubalina and a mellea honey fungi be an example of a facultative parasite they grow in the root of live tree and eventually kill them but theyve adapt to eat both live and dead organic matter theyll continue to fee on their host even after it perish regardless of whether it be actually the fungus that do it in while shiinotics signature move strength sap be obviously base on how fungi sap nutrients from their environment through their mycelia the fact that it drain opponents of their strength yet give them nothing in return bring to mind parasitic fungi which derive all of their nutrients from their host such as honey fungi shiinotics default color scheme also give it the most psychedelic vibe of all fungal pokémon which may not be entirely a coincidence on top of its fly agaric inspiration magic mushroom yes the ones with hallucinogenic alkaloids mainly occur in the tropics and subtropics include hawaii where you may come across panaeolus bisporus and panaeolus cambodginiensis yet another potential mycological reference lie in hachijōjima the southernmost of tokyos izu islands from the end of world war ii through the end of the s the government make efforts to promote it as the hawaii of japan to increase investment and property development it just so happen that multiple species of mycena fungus know to emit a pale green light be abdundant on this island include m chlorophos m pruinosoviscida and m luxcoeli the last of which be long consider to be endemic to hachijōjima until it be find on other japanese islands decades later part mythological root as mention previously shiny shiinotic take its color scheme from various honey fungi make it the second pokémon inspire by a parasitic fungus the first be parasect and these two be link in more ways than just share the same base stat total and evolution level in pokémon sun the pokémon that attack when you collect the tiny mushroom for the lush jungle trial be a parasect whereas in pokémon moon it be a shiinotic in alola paras can only be find during the day while morelull be a nightonly encounter the cherry on top be this shiinotic pokédex entry ultra moon when it start fight for territory with parasect the entire area get completely coat in spores paras only appear during the day be accurate to real cicadas most of which be diurnal but what about morelull well fairies in general have long be think to come out exclusively or more often at night include and up to the menehune a seldomseen race of forestdwellers speak of in hawaiian mythology though consider fairies menehune have more in common with dwarves include their short stocky build and exceptional craftsmanship accord to legend the menehune reside deep within the mountain forest and cave of hawaii away from any human civilization stand at about feet tall barely shorter than shiinotic and only be active at night during which time they would establish fantastic fish ponds roads house and temples theyve be credit with build some of hawaiis finest ancient architecture before even the first polynesian settlers arrive there in contemporary hawaii the term menehune ring be sometimes use to refer to fairy ring perfect circle of mushroom which can cause ring of grass around them to either grow taller or wither and darken depend on the fungus ironically these necrotic zone be the exact thing morelull do its best to avoid create its certainly no coincidence that three of the fungi able to grow in fairy ring be in the amanita genus which shiinotic be already know to draw inspiration from even outside of hawaii fairy ring lend their name to the vast folklore surround them let take a look at some more pokédex entries sun forest where shiinotic live be treacherous to enter at night people confuse by its strange light can never find their way home again moon it emit flicker spores that cause drowsiness when its prey succumb to sleep this pokémon feed on them by suck in their energy sword its flicker spores lure in prey and put them to sleep once this pokémon have its prey snooze it drain their vitality with its fingertips shield if you see a light deep in a forest at night dont go near shiinotic will make you fall fast asleep this be bogstandard fairy behavior many mythological fairies such as redcaps boggarts dullahans rusalki and the nuckelavee be highly dangerous to those they cross paths with others be say to be or utilize willothewisps know in welsh folklore as fairy fire which would entrance or bewilder travelers who saw them at night to reiterate shiinotics territory be generally not worth the risk of encroach on when its dark out just as european folktales would often warn not to step in fairy ring since science hadnt yet advance enough to disprove it the appearance of fairy ring be attribute to supernatural be such as elves witch or fairies dance in circle and could be a sign of either good or bad luck depend on the tradition at worst consequences for enter them could range from be transport to the realm of the fae to unwillingly join in on the nightly dance until your body give out legends would often paint them as be all but impossible to escape from on ones own and since time be say to pass differently in the otherworld your trip to fairyland could have equate to weeks or even years elapse in the mortal realm potentially result in a nearinstant death from old age after break free the only way to safely investigate a fairy ring be to run around it nine time specifically under the full moon accord to a northumberland tradition other creatures say to be link to fairy ring include dragons giant bugeyed toads and even the devil himself at this point you may have remember that fairy ring be not the only mysterious circle associate with night and the paranormal one could say that crop circle be the contemporary equivalent of fairy ring even if they arent create naturally in some ways alien be the spiritual successors to traditional fairies in todays popular culture and urban legends share their unknowability alien morals and knack for abduct random people or livestock at night without a think only to bring them back different sometimes with no memory of what occur when they be kidnap fairies have enough parallel to alien that they would fall under the infamous ancient astronauts conspiracy theory which imply that mythological be such as gods angels and the fair folk themselves be in fact alien who visit earth long ago another discredit theory link the two be the interdimensional hypothesis which say that sight and legends of be such as ghost fairies and ufos be really coverups for visitors from parallel realities or dimension one of the most common perpetrators of allege alien abductions be the classic gray alien which shiinotic line up with surprisingly well the illuminate pokémon share the archetypal gray pitchblack eye and short stature compare to humans it have hypnotic in its name potentially reference the alien brainwash trope and its huge domeshaped cap could very well symbolize either an enlarge brain or a fly saucer from which an alien may descend upon earthlings or use a tractor beam to do the inverse alien be associate with light be nothing new either some of the very first ufo sight of the th century describe them as fiery ball of light in the sky for somewhat more recent examples just look at ets glow finger or the scene from close encounter of the third kind in which color light be use to communicate with the extraterrestrial mothership this be all too perfect for game title sun and moon not only be they literally name after celestial body but they also introduce the light trio the astronautlike dewpider the miniature meteor minior the extradimensional alien call the ultra beasts and the seemingly alien npc in haina desert who return to space after be show a solrocklunatone moreover hawaii have have problems with alien as in nonnative species for centuries just not the extraterrestrial kind yungoos be base on invasive mongooses that be introduce to hawaii to control the population of import rat the ultra beasts be extradimensional be that be use to wildly different environments from alola make them too dangerous to belong there and shigeru ohmori confirm this to be what the ultra beasts symbolize in the first place though there be a couple fungi that be invasive to hawaii none seem like they could have inspire shiinotic if its creation be influence by any invasive fungus in particular it would likely be saproamanita inopinata one of the two species of saproamanita agaric consider to be invasive by the time sun and moon would have start development saproamanita be in the same family as amanita and be once consider to be the same genus some species can even grow in fairy ring s inopinata have not be observe in hawaii but rather new zealand which have also struggle with invasive species start with dog and rat introduce by polynesian settlers this would still fit alola because some facets of the region be in fact inspire by other oceanian islands most notably komala go back to mythology theres one last legendary creature that could hold relevance to shiinotic and if youre a studio ghibli fan you may have already guess what it be the kodama literally mean tree spirit in japanese kodama be a kind of nature deity say to be the animate souls of the ancient tree they inhabit the few report sight of kodama describe them as faint wisps or orb of light or as light with tiny humanoids inside them the ghibli movie princess mononoke have what be by leap and bound the most famous portrayal of kodama depict them with entirely white skin and black dot for eye and mouth pokémon be no stranger to reference other modern media case in point lokix and baxcalibur even the very foundation of the franchise poké ball be an ultraman reference so i could totally believe that the ghibli kodama have an influence on shiinotics design the verdict well thats pretty much it in conclusion shiinotic be one of the most inspire wellthought out pokémon that generation vii have to offer tie together a multitude of mycological and mythological reference from europe hawaii and japan alike into an original forest sprite that wouldnt feel out of place in any number of fairy stories yet also manage to remind us of more modern analogues of the fair folk take into account all these different origins its hard to find a pokémon more deserve of the fairy type than shiinotic tldr shiinotics potential inspirations include lamps and lampshades mushroom folkloric tie to fairies and magic a literal mushroom cloud erupt from a witch cauldron various fungi of the amanita mycena porpolomopsis armillaria and saproamanita genera some of which produce fairy fire parasect serve as its nocturnal counterpart and rival nocturnal hawaiian fairies know as menehune fairy ring also know as menehune ring the double mean of fairy fire refer to both willothewisps and fungal bioluminescence gray alien and ufos and kodama specifically the ones from princess mononoke,1

do you ever sometimes feel pokemon wouldve look better if it stay d pixel art,do you ever sometimes feel pokemon wouldve look better if it stay d pixel art theres nothing inherently wrong with d or anything but the problem be i still dont think gamefreak have properly embrace the extra dimension ill start off by say the problems that theyve be have in d to begin with theres this concept of uncanny valleyhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiuncanny_valley ever since pokemon have be d by the mainline game since x and y theyve enter this and never leave it here be some examples why they continue to use the d model in the same manner as they have their d sprites in battle and it doesnt work in d in the d game the battlefield be an abstraction we dont see how much actual distance there be between the battle mon theyre just attack on circular disc stag and our mind be able to fill in the gap of what happen between easier as a result when a mon use tackle and nudge the air on their circle we can easily imagine them run across x distance to actually ram into the opponent however in d space this no longer work we can see exactly how much physical distance there be between the mon so stay on one side of the battlefield and nudge the air here be one of the examples of the game still be in uncanny valley since it go d they havent fill in the gap that d require to be fill in with npcs this be most apparently see in the remake of once d game like bdsp character still behave in a very stiff unnatural and thus uncanny valley manner in the d space like walk on a grid but not move diagonally so they only ever do degree turn its entirely possible to have diagonal and smoother movement while still be on a grid just take a look at runescape or even in d game lufia the ruin of lore also have smooth movement on a grid also when it come to cutscenes we still have lot of things be imply to have happen rather than be show which be more awkward in d for example rival barry bump into the player in the old d gen game the character be very stoic and dont budge an inch it be possible to have the player be nudge and shake or even get push back a tile but its still easier to accept just a textbox thud in this abstraction however in a d space that same sort of stoic reaction to that situation once again come across as uncanny valley the character dont lose balance or get knock over or anything so it really do just come across as far too stiff in d the disconnect between character move their mouth but have no voice act this be make worse when the cameras be up close to their face in the d game too like sword and shield intro be right up in roses face as he flail his arm and shout about but not a single peep be hear out of him or how piers be do a whole concert at his gym but all we hear be clothe ruffle and foot tap sound i believe even black and white have something more than this for roxie with the d game we never saw their mouth move to begin with due to how lowres the pixel art be but even if we do i think itd be easier to accept this in d rather than d the colour of the character and mon arent as vibrant as the d sprites this be more apparent if you directly compare the model with their d sprite counterparts from the older game charizard be a less vibrant orange and look wash out blastoise be a less vibrant blue etc now of course this isnt to say they havent have some good things in d some of the new signature move like cinderaces ability do get lot of dynamism from the camera move around and dynamic angle but the question end up be be it worth it when everything else suffer next i want to talk about an example of what pokemon could still be if it stay d my think be it couldve go higher resolution with the pixel art and give us more detail sprites and worlds the ds era saw them hybridize d and d with the character be d sprites and the environments be d i think that couldve keep go but the pixel art wouldve need to go higher resolution to match the smoothness of the polygons at higher resolutions theres an artist on deviantart name sassysnivyhttpswwwdeviantartcomspeedxaaa who sometimes do higherres remake of the old d pokemon sprites and it look gorgeous i think its an example of how pokemon couldve look if it stay d pixel art here be some examples of their work below pokemon blackwhite onix high resolutionhttpspreviewredditjebbegmapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledsfdfdcebdeaabde pokemon blackwhite muk high resolutionhttpspreviewredditdtibjbgmapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledsdfbbdfcbdcc theyve even show it look nice with the old bite sprites pokemon crystal hooh high resolutionhttpsiredditbiyngmagif pokemon crystal lugia high resolutionhttpsireddithjszglfrgmagif pokemon crystal lapras high resolutionhttpsiredditmegzetgmagif xb now all of this isnt to say youre wrong for like d pokemon if you do of course this be just my thoughts and observations since the series go d officially what do you guy think what be your preferences,1

cook but later develop into religious vessels of sacrifice and then eventually symbols of imperial authority the greenish color indicate that it be likely make up bronze as most cauldrons be though interestingly it have a round bottom and legs as oppose to a square bottom and legs that be use by those of higher authority one possible explanation be that the cauldron be make very early on before the invention of the legged cauldrons when cauldrons be make almost exclusively by nobles and for them to show their power the age of the cauldron be fit as tinglu be the accumulate fear of people over thousands of years which i will go over later regard their symbolism legend go that an ancient king once order to make massive cauldrons for of its regions to celebrate the kingdoms wealth and engrave the kingdoms wisdom on it for future generations they be so large that it take millions of people months to move them to the capital city once they be build over the years as kingdoms be overthrow and capitals move from place to place the new kings would move the cauldrons with them symbolize the seize of political power a person ask about the quality of the cauldrons be a direct indication that they would want to seize power all cauldrons be eventually lose now that we understand the cauldron why deer my favorite answer be that this be a massive reference to the book the deer and the cauldron by jin yong louis cha jin yong be one of the most influential writers in chinese history who write almost exclusively in the wuxia genre which be mixture between historical fiction fantasy drama and lot of martial arts his book be characterize by rich reference to traditional chinese culture and value combine factual history with mystical power that roughly follow chinese philosophy the deer and the cauldron be his last wuxia novel and be the most unique of them all instead of a traditional hero the protagonist be a lazy and rebellious antihero with no knowledge of martial arts akin to the dark type in pokemon during his journey he make friends with the heaven and earth society a secret society aim to overthrow the qing dynasty and become their spy in the palace through wit deception and sheer luck he become a powerful figure in the government know as the duke of deer cauldron assist both the emperor and his underground friends however the emperor eventually find out about his falsity and force him to either remain loyal to the palace and kill the society or be exile and outcast forever he choose the latter bring his entire wealth and wive to a remote land in the south never to be find again how do this relate to tinglu in the story the cauldron symbolize a kings desire to seize absolute authority while the deer symbolize the common people helplessness to fight back together they represent the struggle of chinese han people against the manchuled qing dynasty this coincide with how the cauldron in tinglu be break the ancient chinese rituals be replace with foreign ones break the traditional norms it also explain the dex entries in scarlet tinglu be reveal to be the embodiment of fear allude to how ancient chinese history be one of many dynasties each one end violently either by a tyrant or an invader each time bring along great chaos that cause mass fear and panic for violet tinglu bring its head to the grind can be see as a metaphor for a dynasty crumble split the country into dozens of fragment just as how tinglu split the earth tinglu be the embodiment of the common people fear of the upperclass authority of the government finally let take a look at how the rest of this pokemon support my theory tinglus ability vessel of ruin lower special attack just as how the iron grip of a strong authority restrict mind and willpower the dark type be selfevident while the grind type likely refer to land and the importance of land in political control in ancient chinese philosophy people reside on the grind and the gods reside in heaven literally sky control over land be direct control over political power especially since ancient china be very much an agricultural society where people live in farm and rarely move beyond land be the people home and thus change in land either politically or physically result in massive fear of the unknown future as people could no longer sustain themselves with what be pass on by their elders the emphasis on homeland be a large part of chinese value as be patriotism another interpretation be that grind be ancient and steady like the rule of a powerful authority this can be see on tinglus body where clear layer can be see like those of mountains or sedimentary rock even build up a mountain at the top these layer can only be form over long periods of time where different climates create different layer that build up on top of one another tinglus chin also have what look like to be stalactites which can also only be form over long periods of time tldr tinglu reference a famous novel of the wuxia genre where the cauldron and the deer symbolize the greed for power and the commoners fear and helplessness in face of violence and chaos cause by those with authority,1

hot takeold pokémon game arent better than current ones,hot takeold pokémon game arent better than current ones ive be play pokémon since the first gen obviously i be very young when i start so naturally i have some nostalgic feel for the older game especially gen now i start play pokémon heartgold again to have a savestate i could shiny hunt on h in and im at the indigo plateau and im struggle hard ive already catch hooh and if not for it i wouldnt get past the first trainer you be incredibly underleveled if you dont grind before every single gym especially if you switch pokémon here and there because apparently pokémon you catch in the wild have to be lvl under the trainer average so either keep the same team from the start or have fun grind you see my main complaint with this game yet its not that its hard its just bore im gonna have to continue put time into grind my pokémon up to level just for me to make it through the elite theres no skill involve in grind idk why people constantly bring up old game like they werent incredibly flaw too xb my current team consist of dratini lvl xb lapras lvl xb rhyhorn lvl xb gyrados lvl xb feraligatr lvl xb and hooh lvl xb sure the difficulty in modern pokémon game feel lack but isnt that because we all know all they type and weaknesses now i can absolutely see why gamefreak pokémon doesnt listen to their fan that much because we be absolutely bias towards the arguably worst game of the series xb and i so far without use medical items ive only manage to get to the third trainer and barely so im seriously consider just stop and put the game away since this already take a ridiculous amount of time to have half of the game through and now struggle this hard,1

this update worry me,this update worry me httpsimgurcomatxloluahttpsimgurcomatxlolua xb so i dont know how other players have find the game recently but for me its be insanely disappoint each event seem worse and worse and every update niantic push out just seem to add more bug or performance issue that never get address to top it off tomorrow be elite raid day xb i reluctantly plan to be out for it despite how poor the game have felt lately and despite how i hate what these elite raid stand for a raid that block a gym for hours which you have to take part in inperson and require coordinate with other players without the ability to remote invite from afar something pretty much impossible for a small almost nonexistant community like mine ive try use campfire to arrange raid in the past but because its still close off to the majority of players nobody where i live in the middle of nowhere seem to bother use it it also lag my phone out so instead despite the fact i have elite raid spawn fairly close by i have to coordinate with friends through discord and travel miles away to have any hope of take part even then i dont know if well have enough players since theres only or others who i know be definitely take part xb i dont mind the travel part really probably since im use to all the extra travel and subsequent expense this game cause by now and honestly it be at least a little better this time since they properly advertise the elite raid day afterall i hear absolutelty nothing about the last elite raid day until i saw the raid egg pop up but after the hoenn tour i just feel less and less motivation to play this game not to rant about that too much but shinies be what i manage this be after travel even further afield ish miles to a town that have a much higher spawn density and number of players i play for the full hours the first day catch god know how many pokemon with my pokeball plus hatch a bunch of egg and do a bigger bunch of raid i even keep an eye on the journal log to see whether any shinies flee whilst be catch on auto with the pokeball plus nothing just the one pokemon i get from a research task a pokemon id already have shiny and the kinda cool kinda dissappointing wild shiny latias which i also already have one of none of the new shinies none of the regional egg ones not the much vaunt shiny groudon i really want or another shiny kyogre i get very lucky with a trade a few years back at least not even any of the decent shinies i already have but be still hunt like crazy xb honestly ive never have good luck with the tour days hell both previous tour i either break my phone or have catastrophic tech problems feel like the tour events be a curse for me at this point but this time i seriously go all out and thats all i get i spend money on the jirachi questline think id at least get extra incense for the weekend since they do list that as a bonus only to be sting because i forget they love to make the tour questlines absurdly long and tedious and literally impossible to finish quickly im hardly surprise that for the third tour event in a row i completely fail to get a shiny unown something ive be hunt since the begin and yet they make it a requirement for the dex completion to get every unown as a shiny then let not forget how they didnt put out any real info until the last minute generously make the event free but then take away the bonus raid pass that usually come with the event to force players to buy premiums or remote pass in the shop i honestly feel the only reason they make it free be so they have the excuse to lower shiny rat etc since its free so people cant complain and let also not forget how bad the las vegas players have it because the location lock ticket events always seem to be a catastrophe plus didnt the game ticket cost like with all the add extras before even have to buy plane ticket accommodation xb and with regard to this latest update notification be all of that suppose to be part of their renew commitment to bolster pokemon go inperson experience because from what i can see theyve just be make the game worse regardless of whether you play inperson or from home i mean for cry out loud if you want players to play and raid in person for one thing actually give more xl rare candy from do raid in person that be mean to be a thing for a while now but inperson raid still almost never drop them xb honestly im just so do with this company and this game right now ive have problems with niantic for years and i mean of course i have since im a rural player it felt like things might finally improve a bite when they add the coronavirus concessions because they actually make the game more accessible but they just seem intent on strip all of that back and then some and thats precisely why this update message worry me xb before this elite raid day event i practically stop play for full weeks and you know what i actually have fun because i wasnt play this game i still play occassionally because its a weak excuse to get exercise and meet up with friends but honestly even if tomorrow go well im honestly consider just quit altogether xb as a last note if youre feel the same way heres something i feel be pretty relevant httpsimgurcomgalleryasxiithttpsimgurcomgalleryasxiit xb edit fix the format also sorry for make this such a long rant i kinda want to give this post more substance by list all the issue that theyve leave unfixed for years now like how pokemon weight xl xs markers search term be still break and how poorly optimise the friends list gift be but with how long the post get i figure i should just save that for later,1

sprite art for dbrigade expansion jungle theme,sprite art for dbrigade expansion jungle theme so ive be play pokemon a long time pretty much as long as theres be pokemon ive be play it ive be impose a self set of rule because of both how easy pokemon be especially once you know the trick and because of a few things ive notice skip this paragraph if you just want the rulesbut one thing ive notice when i play pokemon game be that i always end the game with so much money and so much heal items and i start to think about why i think that be able to walk back to a pokemon center and heal be too convenient so nobody ever waste their super potion on a route or in a gym when they can just go back to the pokemon center and spend a grand total of second heal all their mons and get back to the spot they be at before the only time the player be really push be if they be in cave but modern cave really dont hold up to og cave like mt silver rby victory road rse victory road even mt moon say what you will about mt moon but i have vivid childhood memories of get lose and feel like it take forever to navigate but since nothing ever stop the player from just head back to the pc whenever a large chunk of the game like heal items and even money have less of an impact alright sorry for the exposition heres the rule i use when i play pokemon game just to add a little spice once you enter a routegymhideout you may not leave that routegymhideout through the same way you come in you have begin a journey forward go somewhere that isnt where you come from this mean no casual walk back to the pokemon center when your st mon get poison by bug catcher arnies weedle or whatever save before you enter a routegymhideout if you black out on the route reload the save black out no punishment aside from lose a trivial amount of money that you werent go to spend anyway reload the save mean have to refight all the trainers now there be stake its like a gentle nuzlocke this mean that you need to actually prepare for your journey down the next route by buy and use heal items no avoid wild battle via run away or repel i think that be able to avoid wild pokemon remove the struggle and adventure aspect of journey down a route to the next town the journey wasnt memorable because you avoid everything except two trainers but when you have to battle every wild mon and your pp be run out and the wild mons keep whittle your health down and toss the occasional status effect thats when you feel the struggle the danger the adventure of it all make it to the next city with one paralyze pokemon leave at hp now that be a memorable journey set mode on i feel like this doesnt need explain but be able to always switch to a water type when you know a fire type be come be hella cheat cod if anyone complain about how easy the game be but play with switch mode on you deserve to get turn into a shedinja without wonder guard no use free heal on rout this one be a bite minor but some game have the convenient nurse right outside the cave who heal all your pokemon dont use it or if you think thats a bite harsh cause sometimes they have a long route follow by a nurse before a cave and then another route after the cave then just limit yourself to once per route these be some rule that add some fun to my playthroughs feel free to comment yours id love to read them nuzlockes arent the only way to play some difficult pokemon,0

dw shuttle port theme cover,dw shuttle port theme cover we now have multiple pokemon that can evolve into a few different evolutions with eevee be the most well know example however we be now nine generations in and still havent get the inverse a pokemon that can evolve from multiple preevolutions think about how cool of a mechanic this could be in the game as a type for the stage normal would probably be the best fit but parallel to eevee the preevolutions could be all sort of type the preevolutions could all have different abilities and movesets that the stage could inherit that would leave you with an incredibly customizable pokemon where you have no clue what to expect when face it until it actually attack i can only see two issue with this and both would be pretty easy to fix when breed evolve pokemon the baby become the unevolved form in this case with multiple unevolved form simply have the baby decide by ability as those should still be able to be trace back to the basic form the parentpokemon originally evolve from it could be kinda weird for the trade card game in the trade card game a stage card usually have mark what pokemon it evolve from and there be only room for one on the card not a flawless solution but you could simply not mark it on the card and instead give each of the basics an ability that basically say you can evolve that pokemon onto this pokemon this count as an evolution last part be important because the tcg have some special rule of when you can evolve the variable attack very similar solution use an ability as well this pokemon can use attack from its preevolutions it still need to fulfill the energy requirements sorry if the formulation feel off english isnt my native language so the trade card i have also dont have their word in english this work quite well since the tcgs abilities be quite different from the game in a lot of occasion anyway so it wouldnt matter that those wouldnt be abilities in the game,0

digimon evo line the digimon be goburimon black guilmon renamon and the theme be pure evil,digimon evo line the digimon be goburimon black guilmon renamon and the theme be pure evil and its a terrible execution in game design ui performance graphics write etc i pick it up to play with my younger brother and sister inlaw because they ask me to play with them ive enjoy the interactions that this game have let me have with them its incredibly fun to tear into this the low quality aspects with a group while this be my first pokemon game that ive seriously play ive hear a lot about pokemon from my extend family so i wasnt go in completely blind ive do starfall street path of legends victory road its the psychic gym that break me and make me want to write this post the gym test be banal and insult and its clumsily execute you can button mash the emotion prompt repeatedly during the time window why the plot hasnt be very engage with the exception of the starfall section but theyre so short and i expect it to disappoint in the end oh the sandwich make wow superjank i can drop every ingredient on the table and the top half of the bread and still get a star sandwich that fully heal my party what be this system and why ugh im of the opinion that if someone say they like this game then they be lie to me be blind by nostalgia or they have too much brand loyalty xb i know pokemon mean a lot to many of you like it do for members in my family however please consider not purchase or preordering another game from this ip if this be what they keep come up with interrogate what youve enjoy about the game in the past and look for something else to fill it,0

a very long super post catch me up because i be so behind a lot of these be gonna be quickfire just so i can get them out so uwu let get this show on the road sunkern xb art by doopliss on zerochanhttpspreviewreddituearngrutmapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledsaadaddbcdcaedffd so hoppip be suppose to represent a seed but i express how it kind of make no sense that it be pink and cat like i still think it make little to no sense especially when sunkern be just a few line down what they do wrong with hoppip they do right with sunkern i think sunkern be such an adorable concept its a little sunflower seed like look at it it look like its have a good time and im here for it its such a cool concept that im glad that they do right i actually have a shiny one of these i cant remember if i evolve it or not but its name pandora and i be hunt it on a mirage island on oras she may be a sunflora now i cant really remember v overall id put sunkern in the b rank i think its a super fun concept that they pull off really well i wish theyd take these simple ideas and make them into pokemon like back then i feel like sometimes they go too complex with design lately that they lose out on the charm like where be my dust bunny pokemon im wait game freak sunflora xb art by pokedump on tumblrhttpspreviewredditutrnbvtmapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledseecefabdcdc while i really like sunkern i actually dont like sunflora nearly as much which be a shame because sunflowers be my favorite flower i love sunflowers and feel like they could have do this pokemon really well but they just didnt and its not even the simplicity of it you can make design simple and still work sunflora just lack sunkerns cheer i think theres just something off about it honestly i wish they look more like the adorable sunflowers in mario sunshine i adore those things when id play that game but sadly despite the really good start and my bias for sunflowers sunflora still just lack c which suck i do like the minigame in sv when there be like run around you though that be fun c yanma xb art by decy on twitterhttpspreviewredditgeiyxlvtmapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledsfeffcfaaaeced for a dragonfly pokemon yanma have a really super interest design i thing its aesthetically nice to look at it and pokemon stay pretty loyal to the behavior of an actual dragonfly see these pokemon move in the d model be really fun because of how erratic they fly while i think these little bugger be adorable they do lack a certain something to them i havent ever hear of them be use for competitive or even during normal playthroughs even with an add evolution later on it doesnt seem to help this line at all which just sort of leave them abandon in the useless bug category c which suck because theyre so cute and interest i love dragonflies but yeah overall ill have to put yanma in c wooper xb cona_ on twitterhttpspreviewredditnfkbyhhwtmapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledsfdbbafcffbaefdfb lookie at the little wopper whoop i mean whooper defiinitely dont need to mistake those v but yeah its the little axolotl bean i love wooper look at its dopey little smile if you werent aware already i enjoy pokemon that loo like theyre happy to be alive woopers just a happy little dude and i adore this huggable bean woopers also pretty memorable to me for a long time wooper be the longest masuda hunt i ever do i be well over the ks and be struggle hardcore with maintain the drive to keep go coincidentally i have see a video of an albino exolotl and show my best friend the video express that it look like a shiny wooper my best friend know i be drive myself nut with the hunt make an off hand comment about how i didnt have one and i immediately get one as soon as she send the message in honor of the albino axolotl in the video my shiny woopers name ripley uwu but yeah woopers just a cute and adorable bean with an interest and unique design that lead into one of the in my opinion one of the best gen pokemon to use in game woopers definitely a a pokemon paldean wooper i actually use a paldean wooper in my playthrough of sv and ill be honest im not the biggest fan i prefer the og wooper c its just not as much of a huggable bean c quagsire xb art by berlin lopez on tumblrhttpspreviewredditomnpfytmapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledsabbdddbdcdbeacaefcd so ill start off the bat that i adore pokemon that can completely evade their weaknesses just because of their unique type or abilities i know that quagsire be x weak to grass but im always so interest in the fact that its grind type can completely evade the electric weakness it would have if it be just water i remember berthas quagsire throw me off so much in diamond and pearl visually also i just love this pokemon it fall into the its just happy to be alive and so i cant hate it ive never use a quagsire in a game but i wish i could its such a fun little dude i also have a shiny one of these with a less interest story than ripley but its always fun to have a complete line in the shiny live dex the only complaints i really have about quagsire be the x weakness to grass while also just be a little bland like i have no complaints but i also wouldnt complain if there be a little more visually to the pokemon i still love quagsire though and im more than okay with put it in a paldean quagsire i use one in my playthrough and im not gonna lie i wasnt a fan i felt like the pokemon wasnt tanky enough to live long enough and there be just better options in this region that make it less likely to use although it be the only reason why i beat eri when i have to poison stall her annihliape regardless this pokemons go in the d rank i just i dont vibe as well with the paldean form of this mon day espeon xb art by ohsweetssweetie on tumblrhttpspreviewredditooyqtwemztmapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledsfddebecdfadddadecd xb i love espeon so much its an adorable little psychic cat do anybody expect anything different espeons as adorable as it be powerful but the biggest reason for love come from pokemon colosseum when the two pokemon you start off with be umbreon and espeon i remember become enamor with this badass psychic cat the moment i saw her in this game and she become a star player in my team while espeon isnt my favorite out of the eeveelutions its definitely in the top ive consider get match tattoo with my best friend of an espeonumbreon duo because even though it isnt my favorite i still like it enough that i wouldnt complain about match on with my bestie the only thing that i have to complain about when it come to espeon be that as more psychic type be introduce and more options be bring up the less need it be espeon just kind of become a token eeveelution which be a little upset but i guess on par for how eeveelutions work overall even if theyre important and well love they dont really live up to the love in term of be useful in battle i still think espeon be amaze though and i love that it get put in unite too a day umbreon xb art by ohsweetssweetie on tumblrhttpspreviewredditvjhhclumapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledsfafacbfaefebfbdab while i adore umbreon i dont like them as much as i love espeon i can get behind the really cool and regal design but its far more dog like which isnt as appeal to my cat obsess heart for some reason look for fanart of umbreon unlock the memory more than espeon but i remember be young and on the internet and find videos online of dramatic love storeis between espeon and umbreon use deviantart inspire fanart to tell the stories of two eevees in love that be tear apart by something or other and evolve to save each other or something lol they be so cringey but i remember watch each and every one of them i could get my hand on as well as the cringey sonic ones but shhh this be a poke list but yeah regardless of cringey childhood bias i like umbreon for what it be but not as much as espeon it doenst help that i dont think its nearly as powerful as espeon so it get no pun intend overshadow i will admit that it have an awesome shiny though b day murkrow xb art by on deviantarthttpspreviewredditvkkoceumapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledsceeddfdfcdb honestly like hoothoot i feel like it wasnt hard to get this design right but they really do get this design right i

not sure if i can post this here i really like gabumon and its evolutions heres a model kit for metalgarurumon,not sure if i can post this here i really like gabumon and its evolutions heres a model kit for metalgarurumon i dont understand why ice have no resistances its sad that the only ice type viable pokemon be glass canon why pokemons like mamoswine be big and they should be resistant they should be tanky ice be hard ice be not an easy material to deal with xb you have to be though to resist in cold temperature so why every ice type pokemon be a chip that get obliterate easily xb okay you cant give em grass and bug resistance because grass and bug be already in a bad state xb but grind be a very strong type be super effective against fire rock steel poison and electric its wouldnt hurt to have ice resist it since its already a super effective type vs grind xb dragon because its already super effective vs dragon and dragon doesnt have many weaknesses its one of the strongest type so its not like a resistance to it would hurt xb fly because fly be only resist by steel and rock and be super effective against fight bug and grass and because i dont see bird have enough power to crush ice most bird cant stand the cold xb and for offense ice should do neutral damage vs water and the super effective damage should depend on the weather xb for example an ice type under a snowy weather would deal supereffective damage against water because the cold from the weather would help him to freeze the water xb and on the opposite side water pokemons under rain should be able to do super effective damage against ice pokemons since ice melt faster when you have many drop of room temperature weather xb that would make an interest use in the weather weather move would be more useful and interest if its could change the damage chart like this i know freeze dry and scald exist but its would be an addition to these move xb weather could also boost some passives like thick fat thick fat should be more effective under snow and on the opposite side under harsh sunlight thick fat isnt effective thats would make the game more strategic and weather would play a major role an effective type wouldnt be the only thing need to beat your opponent which would add more challenge xb rework of the freeze status xb freeze shouldnt be a paralysis like thunder wave or stun spore its should be more like a slow big speed reduction attack and attack spe reduction and defdef spe reduction the pokemon would still be able to act but he would be greatly disable which be the normal reaction of the body when youre in hypothermia youre not completely paralyze but youre clearly not in a great shape xb i think its important to make freeze different from paralysis because i dont see what the difference be i feel like paralysis be easier to place but the pokemon can still move sometimes which be weird and freeze be very hard to pull on but then its completely prevent the enemy pokemon from movingattacking make them different from each other would be nice xb and ice move should be super effective vs any freeze target no matter what type they have even if its a firesteel pokemon for example if its freeze the ice move should do super effective damage xb this way freeze become a very interest status if you manage to freeze your opponent hell have to cure his freeze otherwise youll be able to place super effective hit no matter his type xb or if you think its would be too op in that case we could only add a damage boost against freeze target for ice attack this way its wouldnt be too op but would still reward you for freeze your opponent xb what do you think about these change ice would become a nice powerful type with that set of move,0

redigitize decode train spot,redigitize decode train spot title say it all tell me your thoughts in the comment disclaimer some of my pick be slightly influence by the anime because those team fit each frontier brain really well also i decide not have repeat type so each frontier brain type will be unique to them noland bug doesnt have a canonical team but because he have a pinsir in pokémon master i go with bug greta fight have a heracross and breloom in the game and a hariyama and medicham in the anime she also give off the vibe of be a fightingtype trainer with her stance and her belt tucker fire have a charizard in the game and an arcanine in the anime also he be know for be a performer and fire seem to be a fit type for someone who be flashy in front of a crowd lucy poison she like snake and people often think of poison or venom when they think of snake seviper be also arguably her most iconic pokémon and appear both in the game and the anime spenser grass if we forget about the two grass type he have in the anime spenser just seem like a grass type user due to his fondness for nature anabel psychic aside from have psychic type in the anime i just think psychic fit her well she have this very elite vibe about her that make her seem like she have some natural gift for raise powerful pokémon and the psychic type match that vibe she also have a purple aesthetic which help brandon rock hes portray as a treasure hunter or a explorer of ancient ruin we know that he have a regirock and an animeexclusive solrock but i can also see him with pokémon like aerodactyl or relicanth due to his theme thornton steel again he doesnt have a canon team but he do use a bronzong in pokémon master he also seem like he would use a magnezone dahlia ghost almost go with fly because of her togekiss and zapdos however she do have a dusknoir and i could see her with a drifblim or mismagius the ghost type also kind of match her hair which i admit really isnt say much since lot of character have dark black hair darach dark houndoom be an iconic pokémon of his and the dark type have yet to be use by any other frontier brain palmer normal to me he just look like he would specialize in the normal type also he have a regigigas and for some reason i can picture him with a porygonz argenta dragon this one be difficult because she doesnt have a canon team and shes not in pokémon master to decide i consider which type have yet to be use by other frontier brain which be water electric ice fly dragon grind and fairy i choose to exclude fairy because that type didnt exist when argenta be prevalent i then narrow it down to fly and dragon because the only pokémon shes be confirm to use in any source of media be dragonite in the manga fly kind of seem anticlimatic and honestly argentas design make her seem like shes capable of wield some powerful pokemon so i end up choose the dragon type for her i could legitimately see her use a kingdra salamence or garchomp,0

what be the best game currently for you,what be the best game currently for you what it say on the tin what be it that you play or use to play pokemon for story gameplay exploration music competitive i start with pokemon gen silver so i get spoil right off the gate with a really dense contentrich experience as my first pokemon game which also shape my perspective on what a pokemon game should be an rpg game that open up the world to you to explore every little nook and cranny with lot of optional but engage content to indulge in as well as some nonlinear progression for you to customize your adventure let break down gen s progression style its linear up until ecruteak city after which you have the choice to go leave towards olivine and cianwood or right to mahogany and lake of rage both be require along with the rocket radio tower takeover to finish the game and you converge at blackthorn city for the final badge once you reach kanto in the postgame the entire region be open to you to complete in whatever order you desire minus the power plant sidequest to open up western kanto optional areas mean you dont even have to set foot in them one time to complete the game dark cave all three entrance ruin of alph and the second half of union cave whirl islands tin tower mt mortar rout below blackthorn city most of kantos rout and cave even moreso in hgss since cerulean cave and seafoam islands be restore the cave that be present here be all dense and multifloor labyrinthine and have puzzle to solve strength puzzle in some cave slide ice puzzle in ice path so with such a dense experience as my first game clearly an exploration heavy game this be what ive come to expect from every title id play after this i actually play gen red after silver and immediately felt the downgrade in term of quality of life and what not but it at least still offer that sense of exploration and nonlinear progression which start after you emerge from rock tunnel after the first three badge then i would play gen and it be underwhelming but still decent especially emerald with the battle frontier come off gen and its sheer content and feature richness go to gen and see all the remove feature for no apparent reason like day and night and animate pokemon from crystal and the radio and no second region to explore be what make it feel underwhelming to me but little do i know this be actually the start of the series remove feature every generation with no real reason as to why gen platinum be what i play be pretty nice as well and have plenty of nooks and crannies to explore and optional areas the postgame with the battle area felt like a miniregion on its own to explore since you could also do that in a nonlinear fashion gen black be what i play follow by white be where i start to notice the shift in the design philosophy of pokemon game since these be the most story focus game at the time they heavily sacrifice the ability to explore the region for this not only that but the map be a literal straight line to the pokemon league since the right half of the circle be close off until the postgame the areas do at least feel dense still and i do notice that all the optional section be behind the hms i dont think youre require to use an hm to get through the main game black and white be much the same but i be at least happy to see all the additional polish add to the presentation of these game everyone finally animate include all the generic trainers and even us if you be in a wifi battle against another player i fell off the series after this game though it wasnt until gen shield i play specifically that i try to returnand that be when i really realize that the game just dont really care about exploration anymore that be the most bore linear pokemon game ive play yet even more linear than gen which i didnt think be possible but what make it worse be that theres virtually no optional areas to explore in the game dlc not include only talk about the base game here compound with the fact that there be no longer any dungeons in the game either the only two cave in galar be both hallways and singlefloor the only dungeon if you can even call it that be also just an elevator ride i think it be at this point that i start to realize that pokemon be probably no longer a series about explore anymore and be just focus on whatever story they want to tell but be a gameplay first gamer that want to explore obviously i dont care about a pokemon story so none of the d title have appeal to me since,0

bancho oneesama artist 一平 gtmwd,bancho oneesama artist 一平 gtmwd so heres what perplex me greatly we have pokemon and we have humans there be reference to real world animals which make your presume animals that be not pokemon due exist in the pokemon world but in the show we also see very few examples probably because pokemon evolve from these creatures and we know that arceus know as a god level entity be consider a pokemon as we can capture its avatars we also know there be extradimensional alien that we can also capture as pokemon and not just in specialize ball but how long have arceus be around we know it be there and exist before the time of hisui and its say to have create everything but what exactly be a pokemon do humans which as primates come from the same evolutionary line as earth humans or be they just make as human why be humans immune to pokeballs we even see in hisui that the pokeballs dont have a human noncapture protocol program because tech be not of that level so humans be fundamentally not pokemon exceptwhen they be we see from many examples that people do become pokemon ie most ghost type which would mean that the possibility of the dna not be a pokemon but the human be there be also examples of humans become kadabras or even isekaid into it like the mystery dungeons so what make a pokemon what it be and how do humans rise to power in a world that isnt ours we do know that arceus enjoy battle like the eternal battle reverie in legends arceus but humans arent need to cause pokemon battle like wild creatures the battle can easily happen between species and we arent need to bring out the potential of a pokemon others evolve and grow in power without human interaction but it also come to the question we know that arceus be the pokemon god but be he our god do arceus create humans that part have always be obscure be that intentional be we immune to the pokemon affect because humans arent arceus children but something elses children maybe that be why humans have to either die or be transform into a pokemon bring me your thoughts source and theories,0

hypothetical next order mods,hypothetical next order mods ive be want to play older game for a while emulators but havent due to the risk of find a shinygetting attach to a mon and have no way to store them also cant get bank for regional reason on my ds so i be wonder if i be to get a cool poke in an older gameemulator would it be ethical to gen a copy of it and send it to a compatible game on the switch sorry if the question be dumb or for any typos,0
dynasmon line,dynasmon line while currently the talk be only about shut down the eshop i think it isnt really up to imagination if the ds online service get shut down but rather when and obviously this would completely shut down a lot in term of transfer gen to obviously work due to the dualcartridge dses and to work via a local transfer however to to as well as vc to as well as to further generations be completely block be bank inevitably someday shut down too xb so my proposal for this dilemma be the follow one thing i omit in the gen to description be that it be not purely a plain local transfer similar how gen to work but rather the ds with the gen game get a piece of software the pokeporter from the gen game via ds download play some people may remember that mario kart ds similarly allow multiplayer with several people who dont even own the game xb this technique also exist for the ds although i have no idea if or how much it be use however use this one could equally create a ds download play software that work similar to the pokeporter to move the pokemon but this time to pokemon home over a switch or possibly even mobile phone if the ds even allow instal of software via download play one could even go super creative and create a local pokemon box style system to move pokemon locally between the generations include vc game,0

which title should i purchase,which title should i purchase hey pokemon players so i just want to share something personal relate to the pokemon game cause its be weigh heavy on me i realize there be limitations to what they really let people post on this subreddit but it would mean a lot to me if this post be allow and i really appreciate anyone who take the time to read it i be in tear just write this so hopefully this story touch someones heart this be the story of me and pokemon mystery dungeon explorers of sky anyway so let go back to summer i be in love with a woman name jess whom id know since college and we be both big pokemon fan once we move in together we would wake up on days that we have nothing go on which be quite often haha and play on our gbadsds with the tv in the background for hours before really get around to do anything it be like our daily ritual it be of the things early on that really connect us the love of the pokemon universe so day i tell jess im about to replay explorers of sky for the first time in a few years id only ever play through it completely twice as it wasnt that old of a game to my surprise she have never play it she do play the original on gba however so i end up get it on my pc to play on the tv so she could watch me play and take turn play and enjoy the story over the next few days it be amaze to see her reaction to all the cute little things and all the great twist and turn of the plot of explorers of sky i think we play it for about hours a day for a week straight lol all of the amaze music from the game be probably her favorite part actually and after we finish we would still listen to the music through the jukebox occasionally and go back to grind so teleport us to about months later she go away to see her family but have to stay there due to her father have a serious health issue and i couldnt be with her for about weeks include new years i have no idea when she be come back so it be pretty depress but when she be go i do another replay of that game to pass the time and find myself really sad play it without her the music honestly hurt to hear the next winter life be good we have get engage on thanksgiving and days after christmas we go to get match tattoo at a friends house and then someone hit our car yeah she die instantly it obviously be the worst thing thats ever happen to me i be alone again on new years and all i could think about be the music from explorers of sky and it just sting bad so the whole reason im write about this be because i be always afraid to play this game again but i finally do it my life be pretty good now i get clean months ago finally generally be happy but if i be ever gonna fully move on i have to play explorers of sky again i be afraid it would be really depress but i find myself cry in a good way with the part relate to grovyle and go to the future and back especially but most of all with the steam cave and treeshroud forest music play i never cry i hadnt since lol but yeah this game do it but i feel like i finally can enjoy what may be the best pokemon game ever certainly one of my favorite video game ever make i feel like she be with me the whole time i be play it and from now on ill always be grateful to have this game to go back and feel that connection with her even if shes not here anymore,0

watch and i like skullknightmon be gatomon cus it acknowledge her be myotismons minion in og adventure and be foreshadow in a way because the purify version of her mount be her miracle armor,watch and i like skullknightmon be gatomon cus it acknowledge her be myotismons minion in og adventure and be foreshadow in a way because the purify version of her mount be her miracle armor though some may find it forgettable shiinotic be my favorite pokémon of all time and im about to go over all the reason why through a reddit post of excruciate length alas shiinotic be not a very popular pokémon and its easy to see why a lot of people find it too creepy or uncanny to like especially compare to morelull most of its inspirations arent immediately obvious its never be feature prominently in any of the game and even in its first appearance it be horribly overshadow by nearly every other new grass and fairytype pokémon to my knowledge not one person have ever care enough about this freaky mushroomman to write a thorough analysis of its design its relevance to the alola region and just why it have the fairy type until today part mycological root first let take a moment to talk about its heartmeltingly adorable preevolution morelull an emptyeyed bioluminescent mushroom whose name come from morel a famous type of edible fungus and lull refer to how its spores can induce sleep hopefully you havent be pronounce it as morelull while morelull may sound innocuous merely feed on nutrients from tree root and soil to sustain itself and never stay in one spot so as not to cause more harm than it need to it have potential to be as deadly as any fairy pokémon the japanese sun and moon website speak of an incident wherein a morelull colonys spores fly into the vent of an airplane that be fly overhead put those on board to sleep and nearly cause a crash shiinotic be best describe as creepy cute its a taller more humanoid mushroom with the same hollow eye as morelull but the additions of a blank offputting smile and long green mycelium finger through which it drain the vitality of seemingly whomever it see fit make for one of the more unsettle fairytype pokémon or it could be describe as a cross between a toad from mario and the landlord from super milk chan dangerous as it may be its not completely cruel the anime show that shiinotic can also share energy with those they take a like to in a similar manner to how mycorrhizal fungi transfer nutrients from the soil to their botanic symbionts its name can be break down into shiitake a common edible mushroom that grow on decay wood shine refer to its ability to produce phosphorescent light and hypnotic reference the idea of put one to sleep through hypnotism the mindinfluencing psychoactive agents find within certain mushroom and how certain bioluminescent animals beguile prey with their mesmerize light in most languages shiinotics name pertain to mushroom and light in both japanese and korean it be mashade and its french name be lampignon which reveal that its line also take inspiration from night light lamps and lampshades the pokémon company directly acknowledge this in the promotional artwork for the snorlaxs yawn merchandise which depict a bedroom fill with all manner of pokémonthemed furniture include a shiinotic bedside lamp situate atop an aurorus dresser before go into any more detail about what could have inspire bowl pin toads appearance it would be wise to first explain its type grass be easy prior to the revelation that fungi dont actually photosynthesize they spend age be conflate with and incorrectly classify as plant as for fairy fairies have be associate with nature and therefore mushroom for almost as long as the idea of fairies have be a thing over time this have lead some lucky shrooms to be bestow with such monikers as dryads saddle and fairy inkcap as well as shroomish and breloom be place in the fairy egg group during a time when people make less distinction between medical science and magic the potential medicinal toxic or hallucinogenic properties of mushroom earn them a history of use in sorcery and shamanic rituals a trope that still persist in popular culture to this day in fantasy stories theyre often use as potion ingredients by wizards and witch funny enough shiinotics design can be read as a literal mushroom cloud erupt from a cauldron though its hard to say whether or not this be deliberate the mushroom most frequently depict in fairy stories and paint and arguably the most recognizable fungus of all be the poisonous and hallucinogenic amanita muscaria the redandwhite toadstool commonly know as the fly agaric you know the one sometimes its show be use as a seat or dwell by a fairy or gnome other time it be but one detail in an enchant forest fill with wonder it have since be adopt by popular culture as the goto look for a wild mushroom start with renaissance paint and work its way up through alice in wonderland to the smurfs to mario and minecraft to even pokémons fifth generation of game which use it as a basis for foongus and amoonguss some have also speculate the fly agaric to have religious connotations of vary level of plausibility from be the soma describe in ancient hindu texts to even be the forbid fruit consume by adam and eve in the garden of eden the amanita genus be best know for its poisonous species include some of the most toxic toadstools know to man while some be in fact safe to eat provide they be correctly identify others contain downright deadly level of toxins though shiinotic may not be poisonous lack the type and only learn one poisontype move it share some of the other trademark of mushroom in this genus include a wide convex cap cover in patch or warts and a volva thats the pink sacklike structure that form the lower part of shiinotics body a remnant of the universal veil that envelop the mushroom during its infancy in addition to amanita shiinotic be base on mycena fungi of which species be know to produce fairy fire fairy fire be one of the three name for the ethereal glow produce by chemical reactions within certain fungi on decay wood the others be foxfire and chimpanzee fire in particular shiinotics pink cap be reminiscent of species such as m rosella m pura and m purpureofusca if we branch out to other families an even closer match be the pink waxcap porpolomopsis calyptriformis while foxfireproducing fungi mainly emit it from the mycelium the fruitbody or both the slippery mycena roridomyces roridus specifically only have bioluminescent spores the anime show that this isnt true of morelull nor shiinotic but nevertheless their pokédex entries mainly describe their light as be emit from their spores likewise m pruinosoviscida be know to emit light from both fruitbody and spores other mycena species that may hold relevance here include m interrupta and m nargan also know as the pixies parasol and the spot pixie cap respectively as well as several species that go by variations of fairy helmet such as the bleed fairy helmet m haematopus all of this be of course a perfect fit for alola bioluminescent fungi be most common in temperate and tropical climates and hawaii be know as the rainbow state hence team rainbow rocket the prism pokémon necrozma miniors many color and the bedazzle bruxish hawaii be home to many species capable of produce light mostly aquatic animals and bacteria but also the fungus armillaria nabsnona whose mycelium be bioluminescent in general armillaria be better know as honey fungi for many of their species have yellow yellowishbrown or straightup brown cap that match up with shiny shiinotics such as a ostoyae a luteobubalina and a mellea honey fungi be an example of a facultative parasite they grow in the root of live tree and eventually kill them but theyve adapt to eat both live and dead organic matter theyll continue to fee on their host even after it perish regardless of whether it be actually the fungus that do it in while shiinotics signature move strength sap be obviously base on how fungi sap nutrients from their environment through their mycelia the fact that it drain opponents of their strength yet give them nothing in return bring to mind parasitic fungi which derive all of their nutrients from their host such as honey fungi shiinotics default color scheme also give it the most psychedelic vibe of all fungal pokémon which may not be entirely a coincidence on top of its fly agaric inspiration magic mushroom yes the ones with hallucinogenic alkaloids mainly occur in the tropics and subtropics include hawaii where you may come across panaeolus bisporus and panaeolus cambodginiensis yet another potential mycological reference lie in hachijōjima the southernmost of tokyos izu islands from the end of world war ii through the end of the s the government make efforts to promote it as the hawaii of japan to increase investment and property development it just so happen that multiple species of mycena fungus know to emit a pale green light be abdundant on this island include m chlorophos m pruinosoviscida and m luxcoeli the last of which be long consider to be endemic to hachijōjima until it be find on other japanese islands decades later part mythological root as mention previously shiny shiinotic take its color scheme from various honey fungi make it the second pokémon inspire by a parasitic fungus the first be parasect and these two be link in more ways than just share the same base stat total and evolution level in pokémon sun the pokémon that attack when you collect the tiny mushroom for the lush jungle trial be a parasect whereas in pokémon moon it be a shiinotic in alola paras can only be find during the day while morelull be a nightonly encounter the cherry on top be this shiinotic pokédex entry ultra moon when it start fight for territory with parasect the entire area get completely coat in spores paras only appear during the day be accurate to real cicadas most of which be diurnal but what about morelull well fairies in general have long be think to come out exclusively or more often at night include and up to the menehune a seldomseen race of forestdwellers speak of in hawaiian mythology though consider fairies menehune have more in common with dwarves include their short stocky build and exceptional craftsmanship accord to legend the menehune reside deep within the mountain forest and cave of hawaii away from any human civilization stand at about feet tall barely shorter than shiinotic and only be active at night during which time they would establish fantastic fish ponds roads house and temples theyve be credit with build some of hawaiis finest ancient architecture before even the first polynesian settlers arrive there in contemporary hawaii the term menehune ring be sometimes use to refer to fairy ring perfect circle of mushroom which can cause ring of grass around them to either grow taller or wither and darken depend on the fungus ironically these necrotic zone be the exact thing morelull do its best to avoid create its certainly no coincidence that three of the fungi able to grow in fairy ring be in the amanita genus which shiinotic be already know to draw inspiration from even outside of hawaii fairy ring lend their name to the vast folklore surround them let take a look at some more pokédex entries sun forest where shiinotic live be treacherous to enter at night people confuse by its strange light can never find their way home again moon it emit flicker spores that cause drowsiness when its prey succumb to sleep this pokémon feed on them by suck in their energy sword its flicker spores lure in prey and put them to sleep once this pokémon have its prey snooze it drain their vitality with its fingertips shield if you see a light deep in a forest at night dont go near shiinotic will make you fall fast asleep this be bogstandard fairy behavior many mythological fairies such as redcaps boggarts dullahans rusalki and the nuckelavee be highly dangerous to those they cross paths with others be say to be or utilize willothewisps know in welsh folklore as fairy fire which would entrance or bewilder travelers who saw them at night to reiterate shiinotics territory be generally not worth the risk of encroach on when its dark out just as european folktales would often warn not to step in fairy ring since science hadnt yet advance enough to disprove it the appearance of fairy ring be attribute to supernatural be such as elves witch or fairies dance in circle and could be a sign of either good or bad luck depend on the tradition at worst consequences for enter them could range from be transport to the realm of the fae to unwillingly join in on the nightly dance until your body give out legends would often paint them as be all but impossible to escape from on ones own and since time be say to pass differently in the otherworld your trip to fairyland could have equate to weeks or even years elapse in the mortal realm potentially result in a nearinstant death from old age after break free the only way to safely investigate a fairy ring be to run around it nine time specifically under the full moon accord to a northumberland tradition other creatures say to be link to fairy ring include dragons giant bugeyed toads and even the devil himself at this point you may have remember that fairy ring be not the only mysterious circle associate with night and the paranormal one could say that crop circle be the contemporary equivalent of fairy ring even if they arent create naturally in some ways alien be the spiritual successors to traditional fairies in todays popular culture and urban legends share their unknowability alien morals and knack for abduct random people or livestock at night without a think only to bring them back different sometimes with no memory of what occur when they be kidnap fairies have enough parallel to alien that they would fall under the infamous ancient astronauts conspiracy theory which imply that mythological be such as gods angels and the fair folk themselves be in fact alien who visit earth long ago another discredit theory link the two be the interdimensional hypothesis which say that sight and legends of be such as ghost fairies and ufos be really coverups for visitors from parallel realities or dimension one of the most common perpetrators of allege alien abductions be the classic gray alien which shiinotic line up with surprisingly well the illuminate pokémon share the archetypal gray pitchblack eye and short stature compare to humans it have hypnotic in its name potentially reference the alien brainwash trope and its huge domeshaped cap could very well symbolize either an enlarge brain or a fly saucer from which an alien may descend upon earthlings or use a tractor beam to do the inverse alien be associate with light be nothing new either some of the very first ufo sight of the th century describe them as fiery ball of light in the sky for somewhat more recent examples just look at ets glow finger or the scene from close encounter of the third kind in which color light be use to communicate with the extraterrestrial mothership this be all too perfect for game title sun and moon not only be they literally name after celestial body but they also introduce the light trio the astronautlike dewpider the miniature meteor minior the extradimensional alien call the ultra beasts and the seemingly alien npc in haina desert who return to space after be show a solrocklunatone moreover hawaii have have problems with alien as in nonnative species for centuries just not the extraterrestrial kind yungoos be base on invasive mongooses that be introduce to hawaii to control the population of import rat the ultra beasts be extradimensional be that be use to wildly different environments from alola make them too dangerous to belong there and shigeru ohmori confirm this to be what the ultra beasts symbolize in the first place though there be a couple fungi that be invasive to hawaii none seem like they could have inspire shiinotic if its creation be influence by any invasive fungus in particular it would likely be saproamanita inopinata one of the two species of saproamanita agaric consider to be invasive by the time sun and moon would have start development saproamanita be in the same family as amanita and be once consider to be the same genus some species can even grow in fairy ring s inopinata have not be observe in hawaii but rather new zealand which have also struggle with invasive species start with dog and rat introduce by polynesian settlers this would still fit alola because some facets of the region be in fact inspire by other oceanian islands most notably komala go back to mythology theres one last legendary creature that could hold relevance to shiinotic and if youre a studio ghibli fan you may have already guess what it be the kodama literally mean tree spirit in japanese kodama be a kind of nature deity say to be the animate souls of the ancient tree they inhabit the few report sight of kodama describe them as faint wisps or orb of light or as light with tiny humanoids inside them the ghibli movie princess mononoke have what be by leap and bound the most famous portrayal of kodama depict them with entirely white skin and black dot for eye and mouth pokémon be no stranger to reference other modern media case in point lokix and baxcalibur even the very foundation of the franchise poké ball be an ultraman reference so i could totally believe that the ghibli kodama have an influence on shiinotics design the verdict well thats pretty much it in conclusion shiinotic be one of the most inspire wellthought out pokémon that generation vii have to offer tie together a multitude of mycological and mythological reference from europe hawaii and japan alike into an original forest sprite that wouldnt feel out of place in any number of fairy stories yet also manage to remind us of more modern analogues of the fair folk take into account all these different origins its hard to find a pokémon more deserve of the fairy type than shiinotic tldr shiinotics potential inspirations include lamps and lampshades mushroom folkloric tie to fairies and magic a literal mushroom cloud erupt from a witch cauldron various fungi of the amanita mycena porpolomopsis armillaria and saproamanita genera some of which produce fairy fire parasect serve as its nocturnal counterpart and rival nocturnal hawaiian fairies know as menehune fairy ring also know as menehune ring the double mean of fairy fire refer to both willothewisps and fungal bioluminescence gray alien and ufos and kodama specifically the ones from princess mononoke,0

next order what things reduce lifespan,next order what things reduce lifespan theres nothing inherently wrong with d or anything but the problem be i still dont think gamefreak have properly embrace the extra dimension ill start off by say the problems that theyve be have in d to begin with theres this concept of uncanny valleyhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiuncanny_valley ever since pokemon have be d by the mainline game since x and y theyve enter this and never leave it here be some examples why they continue to use the d model in the same manner as they have their d sprites in battle and it doesnt work in d in the d game the battlefield be an abstraction we dont see how much actual distance there be between the battle mon theyre just attack on circular disc stag and our mind be able to fill in the gap of what happen between easier as a result when a mon use tackle and nudge the air on their circle we can easily imagine them run across x distance to actually ram into the opponent however in d space this no longer work we can see exactly how much physical distance there be between the mon so stay on one side of the battlefield and nudge the air here be one of the examples of the game still be in uncanny valley since it go d they havent fill in the gap that d require to be fill in with npcs this be most apparently see in the remake of once d game like bdsp character still behave in a very stiff unnatural and thus uncanny valley manner in the d space like walk on a grid but not move diagonally so they only ever do degree turn its entirely possible to have diagonal and smoother movement while still be on a grid just take a look at runescape or even in d game lufia the ruin of lore also have smooth movement on a grid also when it come to cutscenes we still have lot of things be imply to have happen rather than be show which be more awkward in d for example rival barry bump into the player in the old d gen game the character be very stoic and dont budge an inch it be possible to have the player be nudge and shake or even get push back a tile but its still easier to accept just a textbox thud in this abstraction however in a d space that same sort of stoic reaction to that situation once again come across as uncanny valley the character dont lose balance or get knock over or anything so it really do just come across as far too stiff in d the disconnect between character move their mouth but have no voice act this be make worse when the cameras be up close to their face in the d game too like sword and shield intro be right up in roses face as he flail his arm and shout about but not a single peep be hear out of him or how piers be do a whole concert at his gym but all we hear be clothe ruffle and foot tap sound i believe even black and white have something more than this for roxie with the d game we never saw their mouth move to begin with due to how lowres the pixel art be but even if we do i think itd be easier to accept this in d rather than d the colour of the character and mon arent as vibrant as the d sprites this be more apparent if you directly compare the model with their d sprite counterparts from the older game charizard be a less vibrant orange and look wash out blastoise be a less vibrant blue etc now of course this isnt to say they havent have some good things in d some of the new signature move like cinderaces ability do get lot of dynamism from the camera move around and dynamic angle but the question end up be be it worth it when everything else suffer next i want to talk about an example of what pokemon could still be if it stay d my think be it couldve go higher resolution with the pixel art and give us more detail sprites and worlds the ds era saw them hybridize d and d with the character be d sprites and the environments be d i think that couldve keep go but the pixel art wouldve need to go higher resolution to match the smoothness of the polygons at higher resolutions theres an artist on deviantart name sassysnivyhttpswwwdeviantartcomspeedxaaa who sometimes do higherres remake of the old d pokemon sprites and it look gorgeous i think its an example of how pokemon couldve look if it stay d pixel art here be some examples of their work below pokemon blackwhite onix high resolutionhttpspreviewredditjebbegmapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledsfdfdcebdeaabde pokemon blackwhite muk high resolutionhttpspreviewredditdtibjbgmapngwidthformatpngautowebpvenabledsdfbbdfcbdcc theyve even show it look nice with the old bite sprites pokemon crystal hooh high resolutionhttpsiredditbiyngmagif pokemon crystal lugia high resolutionhttpsireddithjszglfrgmagif pokemon crystal lapras high resolutionhttpsiredditmegzetgmagif xb now all of this isnt to say youre wrong for like d pokemon if you do of course this be just my thoughts and observations since the series go d officially what do you guy think what be your preferences,0

be use by those of higher authority one possible explanation be that the cauldron be make very early on before the invention of the legged cauldrons when cauldrons be make almost exclusively by nobles and for them to show their power the age of the cauldron be fit as tinglu be the accumulate fear of people over thousands of years which i will go over later regard their symbolism legend go that an ancient king once order to make massive cauldrons for of its regions to celebrate the kingdoms wealth and engrave the kingdoms wisdom on it for future generations they be so large that it take millions of people months to move them to the capital city once they be build over the years as kingdoms be overthrow and capitals move from place to place the new kings would move the cauldrons with them symbolize the seize of political power a person ask about the quality of the cauldrons be a direct indication that they would want to seize power all cauldrons be eventually lose now that we understand the cauldron why deer my favorite answer be that this be a massive reference to the book the deer and the cauldron by jin yong louis cha jin yong be one of the most influential writers in chinese history who write almost exclusively in the wuxia genre which be mixture between historical fiction fantasy drama and lot of martial arts his book be characterize by rich reference to traditional chinese culture and value combine factual history with mystical power that roughly follow chinese philosophy the deer and the cauldron be his last wuxia novel and be the most unique of them all instead of a traditional hero the protagonist be a lazy and rebellious antihero with no knowledge of martial arts akin to the dark type in pokemon during his journey he make friends with the heaven and earth society a secret society aim to overthrow the qing dynasty and become their spy in the palace through wit deception and sheer luck he become a powerful figure in the government know as the duke of deer cauldron assist both the emperor and his underground friends however the emperor eventually find out about his falsity and force him to either remain loyal to the palace and kill the society or be exile and outcast forever he choose the latter bring his entire wealth and wive to a remote land in the south never to be find again how do this relate to tinglu in the story the cauldron symbolize a kings desire to seize absolute authority while the deer symbolize the common people helplessness to fight back together they represent the struggle of chinese han people against the manchuled qing dynasty this coincide with how the cauldron in tinglu be break the ancient chinese rituals be replace with foreign ones break the traditional norms it also explain the dex entries in scarlet tinglu be reveal to be the embodiment of fear allude to how ancient chinese history be one of many dynasties each one end violently either by a tyrant or an invader each time bring along great chaos that cause mass fear and panic for violet tinglu bring its head to the grind can be see as a metaphor for a dynasty crumble split the country into dozens of fragment just as how tinglu split the earth tinglu be the embodiment of the common people fear of the upperclass authority of the government finally let take a look at how the rest of this pokemon support my theory tinglus ability vessel of ruin lower special attack just as how the iron grip of a strong authority restrict mind and willpower the dark type be selfevident while the grind type likely refer to land and the importance of land in political control in ancient chinese philosophy people reside on the grind and the gods reside in heaven literally sky control over land be direct control over political power especially since ancient china be very much an agricultural society where people live in farm and rarely move beyond land be the people home and thus change in land either politically or physically result in massive fear of the unknown future as people could no longer sustain themselves with what be pass on by their elders the emphasis on homeland be a large part of chinese value as be patriotism another interpretation be that grind be ancient and steady like the rule of a powerful authority this can be see on tinglus body where clear layer can be see like those of mountains or sedimentary rock even build up a mountain at the top these layer can only be form over long periods of time where different climates create different layer that build up on top of one another tinglus chin also have what look like to be stalactites which can also only be form over long periods of time tldr tinglu reference a famous novel of the wuxia genre where the cauldron and the deer symbolize the greed for power and the commoners fear and helplessness in face of violence and chaos cause by those with authority,0

recently wrap up my ps collection,recently wrap up my ps collection ive be play pokémon since the first gen obviously i be very young when i start so naturally i have some nostalgic feel for the older game especially gen now i start play pokémon heartgold again to have a savestate i could shiny hunt on h in and im at the indigo plateau and im struggle hard ive already catch hooh and if not for it i wouldnt get past the first trainer you be incredibly underleveled if you dont grind before every single gym especially if you switch pokémon here and there because apparently pokémon you catch in the wild have to be lvl under the trainer average so either keep the same team from the start or have fun grind you see my main complaint with this game yet its not that its hard its just bore im gonna have to continue put time into grind my pokémon up to level just for me to make it through the elite theres no skill involve in grind idk why people constantly bring up old game like they werent incredibly flaw too xb my current team consist of dratini lvl xb lapras lvl xb rhyhorn lvl xb gyrados lvl xb feraligatr lvl xb and hooh lvl xb sure the difficulty in modern pokémon game feel lack but isnt that because we all know all they type and weaknesses now i can absolutely see why gamefreak pokémon doesnt listen to their fan that much because we be absolutely bias towards the arguably worst game of the series xb and i so far without use medical items ive only manage to get to the third trainer and barely so im seriously consider just stop and put the game away since this already take a ridiculous amount of time to have half of the game through and now struggle this hard,0

just how tolerable be the plat mechanic in lose evolution,just how tolerable be the plat mechanic in lose evolution httpsimgurcomatxloluahttpsimgurcomatxlolua xb so i dont know how other players have find the game recently but for me its be insanely disappoint each event seem worse and worse and every update niantic push out just seem to add more bug or performance issue that never get address to top it off tomorrow be elite raid day xb i reluctantly plan to be out for it despite how poor the game have felt lately and despite how i hate what these elite raid stand for a raid that block a gym for hours which you have to take part in inperson and require coordinate with other players without the ability to remote invite from afar something pretty much impossible for a small almost nonexistant community like mine ive try use campfire to arrange raid in the past but because its still close off to the majority of players nobody where i live in the middle of nowhere seem to bother use it it also lag my phone out so instead despite the fact i have elite raid spawn fairly close by i have to coordinate with friends through discord and travel miles away to have any hope of take part even then i dont know if well have enough players since theres only or others who i know be definitely take part xb i dont mind the travel part really probably since im use to all the extra travel and subsequent expense this game cause by now and honestly it be at least a little better this time since they properly advertise the elite raid day afterall i hear absolutelty nothing about the last elite raid day until i saw the raid egg pop up but after the hoenn tour i just feel less and less motivation to play this game not to rant about that too much but shinies be what i manage this be after travel even further afield ish miles to a town that have a much higher spawn density and number of players i play for the full hours the first day catch god know how many pokemon with my pokeball plus hatch a bunch of egg and do a bigger bunch of raid i even keep an eye on the journal log to see whether any shinies flee whilst be catch on auto with the pokeball plus nothing just the one pokemon i get from a research task a pokemon id already have shiny and the kinda cool kinda dissappointing wild shiny latias which i also already have one of none of the new shinies none of the regional egg ones not the much vaunt shiny groudon i really want or another shiny kyogre i get very lucky with a trade a few years back at least not even any of the decent shinies i already have but be still hunt like crazy xb honestly ive never have good luck with the tour days hell both previous tour i either break my phone or have catastrophic tech problems feel like the tour events be a curse for me at this point but this time i seriously go all out and thats all i get i spend money on the jirachi questline think id at least get extra incense for the weekend since they do list that as a bonus only to be sting because i forget they love to make the tour questlines absurdly long and tedious and literally impossible to finish quickly im hardly surprise that for the third tour event in a row i completely fail to get a shiny unown something ive be hunt since the begin and yet they make it a requirement for the dex completion to get every unown as a shiny then let not forget how they didnt put out any real info until the last minute generously make the event free but then take away the bonus raid pass that usually come with the event to force players to buy premiums or remote pass in the shop i honestly feel the only reason they make it free be so they have the excuse to lower shiny rat etc since its free so people cant complain and let also not forget how bad the las vegas players have it because the location lock ticket events always seem to be a catastrophe plus didnt the game ticket cost like with all the add extras before even have to buy plane ticket accommodation xb and with regard to this latest update notification be all of that suppose to be part of their renew commitment to bolster pokemon go inperson experience because from what i can see theyve just be make the game worse regardless of whether you play inperson or from home i mean for cry out loud if you want players to play and raid in person for one thing actually give more xl rare candy from do raid in person that be mean to be a thing for a while now but inperson raid still almost never drop them xb honestly im just so do with this company and this game right now ive have problems with niantic for years and i mean of course i have since im a rural player it felt like things might finally improve a bite when they add the coronavirus concessions because they actually make the game more accessible but they just seem intent on strip all of that back and then some and thats precisely why this update message worry me xb before this elite raid day event i practically stop play for full weeks and you know what i actually have fun because i wasnt play this game i still play occassionally because its a weak excuse to get exercise and meet up with friends but honestly even if tomorrow go well im honestly consider just quit altogether xb as a last note if youre feel the same way heres something i feel be pretty relevant httpsimgurcomgalleryasxiithttpsimgurcomgalleryasxiit xb edit fix the format also sorry for make this such a long rant i kinda want to give this post more substance by list all the issue that theyve leave unfixed for years now like how pokemon weight xl xs markers search term be still break and how poorly optimise the friends list gift be but with how long the post get i figure i should just save that for later,0
