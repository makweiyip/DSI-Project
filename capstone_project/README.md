# Capstone Project- Image Classification

# Problem Statement

- To build a classification machine learning model to accurately classify different type of ships base on the images  

- Model will be a supervised learning model, trained on dataset of ship images

- This model aim to also predict the country the warship is from

- The project is important for stakeholder such as Navy and  maritime authorities, which require reliable ship classification information for decision-making at the same time reduce manpower require and human error on wrongly classify of ship type

# Data set
 - images collection of open source

# Evaluation 
- The success of the model will be evaluated based on its accuracy in predicting the types of ship
